A young man was killed.
Being a detective, that’s nothing new for me.
But, let me tell you … this case changed my life.
Why?
I’m going to tell you.
My name’s not relevant. I’m just an ordinary man doing his job.
Solving crime cases has always been my dream. {w=0.4}Since I was a kid, I guess.
It’s been a few years, but I still remember that one case.
The murder, which is known as the “Black Swan” case.
Thinking about it now, it’s kinda ironic, but let me start from the beginning.
One thing you should know beforehand: People always see what they want to see, and they hear what they want to hear.
Sorry for being so cryptic, but I promise it’ll make sense, eventually.
So, there was this mansion …
I-I cannot talk!
His wife found his body not long ago. Evidently, she was not able to answer my questions right in that moment.
I understand. I will take a look around, if that’s okay.
She just nodded and I went to the crime scene.
There was the chalk on the ground and a lot of glass.
Looking up, I saw that one of the windows was broken.
He was obviously pushed out of the window.
Their home sure is big, and it seems the level of surveillance is quite high on this property.
I figured that it must have been someone who had access to it. {w=0.6}Well, obviously.
Maybe it was one of their staff members, or his wife herself.
Yeah, right. It’s always the wife, isn’t it?
I decided to go back to her. Maybe I could get something out of her, after all.
She was still in tears when I slowly approached her.
What do you want?
My apologies again, ma’am. I'd like to know who was there when … it happened.
It’s Friday afternoon, so only Cain was at the house. He’s our cleaner.
Where is he now?
I think he’s speaking with one of your colleagues.
Thank you, ma’am. And … I’m sorry.
I’ve always been so bad with all of this condolences stuff. Well, whatever.
Maybe that cleaner knew something. I saw him across the yard.
On the other hand … some of my colleagues were going into the house, to inspect the crime scene I guess.
I wanted to see the crime scene first. Maybe there were some hints.
It took a while to reach the room. Damn, that place was huge!
When I arrived, I was surprised to find that it was a guest room.
Why would the man of the house be in that room?
I saw the broken window … and other things.
There are two glasses. Looks like someone drank wine recently.
One of the glasses has something on it … Looks like lipstick.
Did the victim and his wife drink wine before it happened?
Maybe it was an accident. But wouldn’t she have hidden the glasses, then?
Or did he have an affair with some woman?
The wine glasses are obviously connected to the murder.
The window is closed. This one looks undamaged.
That’s the window that caused the victim’s death. Well, unintentionally of course.
Some painting. I’m pretty sure it has nothing to do with the murder.
An average painting you’d find in every guest room.
For decoration purposes, I guess. Not important.
It’s a chest. There’s probably a treasure in it.
Okay, I’m not really good at making jokes.
Look at this! It’s a red wine stain.
Since the cleaner is here, this one must have happened recently!
This box is empty.
It’s a personal photo of the victim.
Some photos. I’m not interested in their personal lives, I just want to solve the case.
I left the house.
I didn’t want to miss my chance to talk with the cleaner.
C-can I help you?
Maybe. Could you tell me what happened?
Sure. I-I was cleaning the foyer when the landlady came home.
Where had she been?
I interrupted him. I needed to know everything!
S-she was w-w-with a friend. Her name is Sarah,{w=0.7} I think.
I made a mental note to ask Audrey about her later.
Thanks. Please go on.
When she came home, she seemed to be in a good mood.
W-well, she just came back from a fun day, so I guess that’s natural.
Makes sense.
R-right.
Anyway … I was just about t-to call it a day when …
When I heard an earpiercing scream echoing through the house.
That’s when she found the body?
Y-yes.
Didn’t you hear the window breaking?
I’m usually listening to music when nobody e-else is here. When she arrived, I took out my earphones.
Dammit! So the murder must have occurred before his wife arrived.
Or not. The house is pretty big, he could’ve overheard it even without earphones.
Nobody else was at home?
I-I know what this must look like! But I didn’t kill him, I swear!
You have nothing to worry about, if you’re innocent.
I didn’t emphasize the if. He seemed to be worried enough already.
I-I guess.
Everything happened so fast. I’m afraid I cannot really tell you much more.
That’s fine. You already helped a bit.
R-really? I’m glad. If you need anything, you can stop by at my apartment. Here is my address.
All right.
Ah, detective. Do you have news?
Indeed.
There are two glasses of wine in the guest room. One of it has lipstick on it.
…
I know.
I figured as much. Can you elaborate?
I-I found the room like that and I didn’t touch anything. I cannot really explain it.
This looks like …
I {i}know{/i} what it looks like! I know he just died, but … but maybe it’s true …
Maybe he was meeting someone else and … things didn’t go according to plan.
That’s what I was thinking.
Do you know who could be … you know?
He has not many female friends … {i}Had{/i}.
There was this girl, Ellen. She used to jog with him and they went to the same yoga course.
A yoga course, huh?
Yes, he always wanted to stay fit.
Do you have an address?
Unfortunately, no. But they always went for a jog in the park.
I see. Maybe I can meet her there.
Someone else?
There’s also Sarah.
Not much.
I see …
Where have you been when it happened?
Oh, I was with Sarah.
Who is Sarah?
Your cleaner said you were with her when it happened?
That’s right. We spent the day together.
I was with her when it happened. We spent the day together.
What did you do?
She frowned, as if my question was too personal.{w=0.3} But she answers, anyway.
Just girl stuff. Shopping, talking, you name it.
What about his enemies?
He had no enemies. He was very seclusive, shy sometimes.
Maybe that’s why he hadn’t many friends, either …
So?
Besides Ellen, and if you count Sarah …
There was only Rob. They were best friends, ‘bros’, they used to say.
There was this girl, Ellen. She used to jog with him and they went to the same yoga course.
A yoga course, huh?
Yes, he always wanted to stay fit.
Do you have an address?
Unfortunately, no. But they always went for a jog in the park.
I see. Maybe I can meet her there.
Someone else?
I can only think of Rob. They were best friends, ‘bros’, they used to say.
Where can I find him?
He owns a night club in downtown.
She gave me the address and I decided to pay a visit later.
I also inquired Sarah’s address and it turned out she just lived a few streets farther away from Audrey.
That should be enough for today.
Thanks, Detective. For everything.
That’s my job.
I hope you will solve this case soon.
Me, too.
I decided to visit Sarah. Let’s see what kind of girl she is.
I knocked a few times, but nobody opened.
Maybe she wasn’t at home.
Suddenly, the door flew open with a crash.
Gosh, what the actual-
Wait, are you the detective?
Seems like it, miss.
Oh, hell.
You already know?
Audrey called me, but she was too agitated to tell me what exactly happened.
But, basically, yeah. Her husband is dead, right?
I nodded and told her everything we knew so far.
I told her about the thing with the window.
If she was shocked by the news, she didn’t show it.
She just took another sip from her glass and stared at me.
It looked like she couldn’t care less.
So, who did it?
That’s what I want to find out.
Oh, I see.{w=0.7} You think {i}I{/i} did it, right?
I didn’t say that. I just want to ask you a few questions.
I didn’t know him that well. I usually spend my time with Audrey.
She didn’t want him to be part of our ‘girl stuff’.
Still, I have questions. It’s just routine, you know.
Okay, shoot.
I couldn’t help but think that this was kind of an awkward wording. But I didn’t comment.
Where have you been today?
I spent the day with Audrey.
I’m sure she told you.
Well, yeah.
We shared a taxi, and after we dropped her off at her house, I went home.
Makes sense, I guess.
Yes, it does.
She called me shortly afterwards.
Thanks.
What else?
I’m sorry to be so personal, but did you have an affair with the victim?
Me? I barely knew him!
No need to get all defensive, it was just a question.
And I just answered: No!
Okay, okay.
That girl sure had a temper.
Thanks for your time.
Just catch that murderer.
Afterwards, I decided to go to the park and keep a lookout for Ellen.
I’ve been told she and the victim would go jogging together sometimes, and they’ve been in the same yoga course.
The park wasn’t that big and I was able to find a woman which could be her.
For a moment, I tried to keep up with her, but she was much more athletic than me.
She introduced herself as Ellen, but she kept running.
When I broke the news she stopped, though.
He … He is dead?! Who would do this to him?
That’s what I want to find out.
You’re saying he was pushed out of the window?
Apparently.
That is so horrible. I cannot imagine … I cannot imagine what his wife is going through right now.
She's shattered.
…
Ellen fell silent. I couldn’t read her face, but she seemed to be in shock.
Can you tell me something about him?
He was always so calm and quiet. He was so easy to be around with.
Actually, that’s why I chose him as my jogging partner.
I see.
He was very reclusive. If I hadn’t dragged him to the yoga course, he wouldn’t have had the courage to go there.
That yoga course …
It’s on Saturdays. He was the only guy in our group.
I understand. Did he have contact with someone else from that group?
Hm, no, I don’t think so. He’d always stick with me.
Could you think of anyone who could be the murderer?
No, absolutely not.
That was not very helpful. Also, it was getting dark, and I still had another place I wanted to visit.
Thank you for your help.
That was everything? Will you find the murderer?
I will, and, yes, that’s it for the time being.
If you need me, I’ll be here over the weekend.
I’ll make sure to contact you again. Thanks.
It was getting late and my last stop would be that night club.
I wanted to know what kind of guy that Rob is.
It was loud in the club. And it took me forever to get to Rob.
Some security guy thought my badge was fake. What a prick.
You wanted to talk to me, Detective?
Yes. Can we talk somewhere quieter?
Sure thing.
He led me to a closed area. Finally, some silence.
That should be better.
I’m sorry to be the bringer of unpleasant news, but …
I told him about his best friend’s death. God, how I hate doing this.
He listened to me carefully. His expression didn’t change at first, but then …
He cried. He cried a lot. It was his best friend, after all.
I-I cannot …
Take your time. I know this is hard.
Who would do this to him? He’d never hurt a fly!
I will find out. I promise. But first, I need you to answer some questions.
Sure, anything.
His wife said you were best friends. Can you confirm that?
Yes, yes we were. He didn’t have many friends.
I heard.
Sometimes he’d visit me in the club. He was not a very outgoing person, he just did it for me.
What did you do in your free time?
Well, the usual. Watching football, working out, playing video games …
I can’t believe we’ll never see each other again.
Where have you been today? Have you seen the victim today?
I was at his house.{w=0.5} Or mansion, more like it. His wife was out and he asked me to spend some time together.
Can the staff confirm this?
I don’t think anyone saw me … It’s Friday so there’s only Cain there.
He was probably cleaning some room while I was there, I’m sorry.
Now I knew that at least three people were there: Audrey, Cain, and Rob.
When you left, he was still alive, right?
What are you implying?! Of course, he was! I wouldn’t kill my best friend!
Sorry, I just had to ask that question.
You work in this night club?
Yes. It’s kind of hard sometimes. But it pays the bills.
He … he always wanted to help me with the club.
But that’s not really his cup of tea. He’d be better off in some office. He is always so shy.
He was, I mean.{w=0.3} Gosh.
Thank you. That’s it.
You can find me here, if you need me.
I’m working here every day, even when the club isn’t open.
I actually have to work for my money, unlike other people.
Whoa, where did that come from?
I-I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. I just don’t know what to feel right now.
I guess I’m just angry.
You’ll hear from me.
Please find the murderer, Detective.
I will.
I had some leads. I knew I could finish that case quickly.
In fact, it only took me two days.
I was sure that it wasn’t an accident. Someone killed him and I knew it was one of them.
Audrey, she seemed devastated. But maybe she knew more than she would let on.
That cleaner, Cain. Is that stuttering and anxious behavior just an act?
Ellen, the sports enthusiast. A guy doing yoga? Don’t get me wrong, that’s totally fine.
But maybe he had other intentions than just ‘staying fit’.
Rob sounded kind of jealous.
He has to work hard for his money, and maybe he was envious on his bro’s lifestyle,{w=0.5} or his wife?
I didn’t know much about Sarah yet. Audrey made her sound like your typical rich girl.
I called it a day.
The next morning, I had to plan my steps wisely.
I knew I hadn’t enough time to visit all places, I just needed to trust my instinct on where to go.
There were five places I had to go. I figured I could only manage to visit three.
Where should I go?
I’ve already been there today.
That’s Audrey’s house.
Hello, Detective.
Hello, miss. How are you today?
I don’t know. It’s weird, you know.
I get what you mean.
She closed her eyes. I could tell she has been crying.
I guess you have questions?
If you don’t mind.
Of course not.
This might come out of nowhere, but … do you wear makeup?
I … I don’t understand.
I have my reasons, I assure you it’s for the benefit of the investigation.
Well, sometimes, I guess. I’m pretty comfortable in my own skin.
I see.
I remembered that she did not wear makeup on the day the victim died.
Sarah is the one who wears makeup often. I only do it occasionally.
I’m not sure how that will help you, though.
It already did.
How long have you known Sarah? Are you on good terms?
We are on excellent terms! I’ve known her since we moved here two years ago.
I expected the neighbors to be quite arrogant, but they’re really nice.
Sarah? Arrogant? No way!
That’s nice to hear.
Yes, I wouldn’t know what to do without her.
She gives me so much strength and inspiration.
Is that so?
Are you being ironic, Detective?
I wouldn’t dare!
The situation is grave.
I know that, believe me.
Let’s get back to your questions.
What do you do for a living, miss?
Oh, you don’t know? I’m a novelist. And not a nameless one at that.
I’m sorry. I hadn’t much time for reading in the last couple of months.
I do not take offense, Detective.
You’re … not a crime author, are you?
Nonsense, Detective. I write romance novels.
You do? What kind?
What do you mean? Of course no supernatural teenage trash!
It’s shocking how kids nowadays seem to like all those shallow Mary Sue characters.
My protagonists are strong female role models!
That’s impressive. What about men?
I’m absolutely {i}not{/i} a gay romance writer. That goes against my beliefs, it’s a sin!
Uh … a-actually, that’s not what I meant. I wanted to know how you portray male characters in your novels.
That goes without saying. It’s all about women. Men are inferior, of course. 
Of course.
Wow, a sexist and a homophobe … Not cool in my book, but it was not my business to interfere.
Anyway, my books are quite popular. My recent one is going be turned into a movie by a famous film studio.
Fascinating. What is it called?
You’ll love the title. It’s called ‘A Malady to Kill For’. {w=0.5}Malady, Milady … got it?
I see what you did there. The title sounds {i}melodic{/i}.
…
That was supposed to be funny, heh.
Funny.
Thanks for your time, miss.
Of course, Detective. Make sure to catch the culprit!
Yeah …
I’ve already been there today.
That’s Sarah’s house.
When I arrived at Sarah’s mansion, she was already in front of her door.
It looked like she was about to go somewhere.
What are you doing here?
Well, excuse me for enjoying the nice weather in front of {i}my{/i} house, Detective!
Sorry for asking.
The question is: What are {i}you{/i} doing here?
Did you find the murderer?
Not yet.
Oh? So what leads you to me? You probably know this, but I have a bulletproof alibi.
Slowly but surely, her attitude started to annoy me, but I kept my composure.
I’m just doing my work, Miss.
Sure you do.
She took another sip of her glass. Hm …
What are you drinking?
It’s something exotic …
It is?
It’s called ‘mind your own business’.
Ah, very funny.
Say, what do you do for a living?
Nothing. I inherited some money.
{i}Some{/i} money? Looks like a helluva money to me.
And have you done some kind of apprenticeship?
I don’t see how any of this is relevant to the case. Do you?
Actually …
Could you tell me something about you?
What for?
It’s just routine to create a profile of all the people the victim knew.
Well …
Single. Rich. Not a murderer.
That’s … not helpful.
I don’t want to be rude, but I have important things to do.
If you’d excuse me …
That didn’t work out so well.
She got into a huge black limousine, and lowered the window.
Hey, Detective. Do you know that quote:
‘I like to think of life as a limousine’?
No? What about it?
‘Though we are all riding together, we must remember our places; there is a front seat and a back seat …’
‘And a window in between.’
What a …!
Self-control, all I need is some self-control.
I’ve already been there today.
That’s Cain’s apartment.
And here I was. That must’ve been Cain’s apartment.
I rang the bell.
O-oh, Detective, it’s you.
I could never tell whether that guy was nervous or just stuttering.
Yeah, it’s me. How’s it going?
Okay, I guess. As normal as i-it can be after a person’s death.
I hear you. Stupid question. I know it sucks.
D-do you want to come in?
Sure. Do you mind if I take a look around?
Not at all, Detective.
Let’s see what I can find here.
Some flowers. Looks like Cain has a green thumb.
Still life. Not really my cup of tea, to be honest.
That’s just decoration, I guess.
Looks comfy! It’s a pity I don’t have time to relax.
Wait! Is there something behind that cushion?
Nah. I’m just messing with you!
It’s for decoration purposes.
A trophy. First place, chess tournament.
Why am I not surprised?
That box is empty.
Fingerprints! But whose?
Just in case.
I’ll probably have the results tomorrow morning.
They’re probably just Cain’s. No point in wasting time like that.
I already took them.
That is … {w=0.4} Wait! That’s Audrey!
D-Detective?
Cain, that is seriously fucked up.
I pointed at the photo of Audrey.
It’s not what it looks like! I-I can explain, really.
Well then, explain yourself.
It is true … I like her a lot.
Dammit, Cain. That doesn’t look good for you!
I know, but you have to believe me. I just admire her.
She is a hard-working woman and she’s always been good to me.
I-I’d have never killed her husband! I want her to be happy.
I didn’t know if I should believe him.
On the other hand, he didn’t make the impression to be a killer.
Or maybe … It’s always those people, isn’t it?
Okay, Cain. Stay calm. I will find the truth.
If you have nothing to do with it, don’t worry too much.
Right …
I’ll look around a bit more.
O-okay.
A photo of Audrey.
Looks like an old woman. Maybe it’s Cain’s grandmother.
Who needs all of this knick-knack?
No offense.
Someone likes to read, huh.
“The Book Thief” by Markus Zusak.
A quote came to my mind.
“I am haunted by humans.” How fitting.
Crime novels. Not really that suspicious, a lot of people read those.
E-everything okay, Detective?
Well, apart from that creepy obsession with Audrey …
…
Yeah, everything’s okay.
I see.
I’ll contact you when I find something new.
I’ve already been there today.
That’s the park.
Nice to see you again, Detective. I guess you have news?
Not exactly. Just more questions.
Oh, no problem. That’s fine with me.
You probably knew the victim better than anyone.
You might be right about that. What do you want to know?
Can you tell me about his hobbies?
Apart from doing sports? Let me see …
He loved reading. That’s the only thing I can think of.
A reader? Makes sense, with his wife being an author.
What kind of books did he read?
Almost everything, I guess. He had a huge collection. Romance, fantasy, science fiction …
Though, I often showed him some of my favorite novels.
And what’s your favorite genre?
Contemporary novels. But is that important for the case?
I was just curious.
What was he like?
Oh, he was very reclusive. That is, when he wasn’t with Rob.
Really? Why?
Rob always made him smile. He even enjoyed going to parties with him.
Parties? Did he go often?
Sure. Sometimes the Black Swan just has to break out.
Black Swan? That an inside joke?
Oh … uhm … no …
That was actually his nickname when … he went to parties.
I’m not sure I can follow you.
He went in disguise, because his wife did not endorse that. He didn’t want her to find out.
In the club, everyone knew him as the Black Swan.
Okay, that’s definitely something new.
The Black Swan, huh?
A reclusive lone wolf but a party-goer in disguise.
Split personality? Or is someone else playing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?
Why couldn’t his wife find out? Did she, in the end?
‘I killed my man because he went to a party.’ What a headline that’d be. But would it make sense?
What do you know about his wife?
Enough, I guess.
What do you mean?
I probably shouldn’t talk about her. I don’t like her, that’s all you should know.
To be honest, I hate her.
Huh? Why is that?
I didn’t expect such a balanced person to hate somebody.
I guess I can tell you …
There are people in this world … who believe in the wrong things.
‘Wrong’ is such an elastic term.
I just want to say … I hope most people nowadays are not as ignorant as her.
Did the victim … love her? Why did he put up with ‘an ignorant person’ like her?
‘We accept the love we think we deserve.’
…
Stephen Chbosk.
I know. ‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’.
A wallflower … Hm …
Detective?
That quote just made me realize something …
Really? What is it?
I’ll keep my speculations to myself for now.
Anyway, I’m glad I could help.
I don’t want to hold you up.
Are you sure? I’ve got plenty of time.
Please, you’re free to go.
Okay.
I’ll contact you, as soon as I find something.
Thanks, Detective.
I’ve already been there today.
That’s the night club.
Oh, Detective. You’re back.
Yes, there are still a few things unclear.
I guess that’s true.
I saw tears in his eyes. I couldn’t tell if they were genuine or fake.
I’ll help you as best as I can.
I want you to catch the asshole who did it.
Anger replaced the tears. Man, that guy sure has some bad mood swings.
I appreciate your willingness to help.
Tell me something about your club.
What do you mean exactly? Our customers, or how the business is?
Uhm … Both, actually.
I don’t see how that’s relevant, but you’re the detective, I guess.
Smartass. I know what I’m doing.
Business is doing okay. Could be better, though. I can’t complain, other clubs are worse off.
And about our customers …
Well, we have all sorts of customers. Old, young, male, female. You name it.
How come? Such night clubs usually tend to be dominated by one target group.
Or maybe that was just in my days …
We organize weekly theme parties. We have a ladies’ night, a gay night, and even a costume party.
That draws many different people in.
I see.
I wondered about whether you are …
Yes?
How do I ask … Well, you know …
Uhm … sorry? What are you trying to say?
I wondered if you are homosexual.
He crossed his arms. It was a personal question, no doubt. But I needed to know.
Maybe he and the victim had a deeper relationship than just being bros.
Only because I’m organizing gay parties doesn’t mean I’m gay.
I’m a solidary person, and I don’t tolerate people who discriminate against others because of something like this.
Whoa, I didn’t mean to …
I know, Detective. I’m just saying. And to answer your question: I’m 100 %% straight.
Duly noted.
Damn, I felt so stupid. Well, detectives have to blunder sometimes.
Can you tell me something about the victim’s mansion?
Well, actually, it is Audrey’s mansion.
He stayed at home and she earned the money.
Independent woman, nothing wrong with that.
But to answer your question …
It’s pretty big and they have a lot of staff.
Do you know them well?
No, not really. I saw Cain sometimes. He’s usually there when I come over.
Or came over, that is.
Okay. Thanks. What else can you tell me?
Audrey didn’t like it very much when I spent time with her husband.
Why?
I don’t know. Maybe she wanted him all for herself.
We used to meet when she was out.
Interesting. Maybe that is important.
That is all I know.
Thank you.
That would be everything for now.
But you didn’t ask anything!
Oh.
I’m the detective, I know what I’m doing.
Obviously.
Hope it helped.
It did.
I see. I hope my information helped you a bit.
I’m sure I understand everything better now.
Well, tell me if you find out something new.
It was too late and I was getting tired.
I would have to continue my investigation tomorrow.
On the next day, though, everything made sense.
That fingerprint comparison was pointless. They were indeed Cain’s fingerprints.
However, I knew I could solve that case today!
Had I enough evidence? Maybe, maybe not …
But suddenly, everything fell into place.
I was so sure I could solve that case.
I contacted everyone who was somehow involved …
And in the morning, we all met in front of Audrey’s house.
So, what now, Mr. Detective?
Now, I’m going to arrest the murderer.
Y-you will?
Already? I hope you’ve got enough evidence.
And why did you gather all of us here? Are you saying we {i}all{/i} did it?
I gathered you, because every one of you knew the victim and each of you played an important role.
An important role?
Exactly.
Well then. Who was it?
Sarah is the murderer!
Are you out of your mind?
Sarah was with me all day when it happened.
I think you’re just throwing around accusations.
But I’m curious. What’s my motive?
You envied Audrey and her wealthiness. You wanted to get back at her!
She’s my best friend, so … no?
Besides, I’m well-heeled, as well. I inherited more money than you will ever make as a ‘detective’.
That was harsh.
Have you considered changing your job?
…
I failed.
Well, she certainly finished me off.
I had nothing on her. Maybe I was wrong?
If only I could give it another try …
You wanted to seduce him, but something went wrong!
When he didn’t cooperate, you killed him!
You really think I’m so superficial? I. Barely. Knew. Him!
You think I’m some kind of psycho sex maniac? You wish!
Besides, Sarah has a boyfriend!
That …
Shut up, please. You are unqualified as detective.
Cannot even solve a murder case! What a joke.
…
I failed.
Well, she certainly finished me off.
I had nothing on her. Maybe I was wrong?
If only I could give it another try …
Cain is the murderer!
M-me?! Why would y-you think that?
Indeed. What would he get from killing my husband?
You envied his and his wife’s wealth.
N-no, I did not!
That’s ridiculous. Why would he kill him because of envy?
You live in a small house and you wanted a lifestyle like theirs!
Y-you are not right about this, Detective. I’d never harm anybody!
Unless you can prove him to be guilty, I say you take a step back, Detective.
Your wild guessing leads to nowhere.
…
I failed.
Was it really him? Maybe I’m confusing things.
What was I missing?
If only I could give it another try …
You killed him because you were jealous!
I …
It’s true that Cain is obsessed with me, but he wouldn’t kill him.
Y-you know?!
It’s not easy to miss.
So, do you confess that you killed him?
N-no! I wouldn’t harm a fly!
If you have no evidence, your accusation is meaningless!
…
I failed.
Was it really him? Maybe I’m confusing things.
The motive seemed plausible, but what about the others?
If only I could give it another try …
Audrey is the murderer!
Me? I was his wife! How do you come to that conclusion?
It was an act out of revenge!
Is that so? You have to be more specific.
What makes you think I killed him out of revenge?
You killed him because he had an affair!
That’s ridiculous! An affair? With whom, then?
He had an affair with Ellen!
I can assure you that he had no interest in me whatsoever.
What does that even mean? Did {i}you{/i} kill him?
No, that means … Gosh, you wouldn’t understand. You never did.
What do you know about our life?
More than you know.
No one knew my husband better than me!
And you, Detective, please leave this property now!
I failed.
But I was on the right track!
What was I missing?
If only I could give it another try …
He had an affair with Sarah!
What?!
That’s ridiculous! We barely knew each other.
I can assure you, Detective, that he had no interest in her whatsoever.
What is that supposed to mean?
Never mind.
Well, obviously our little Detective has no idea what he is talking about.
…
I failed.
But I was on the right track!
What was I missing?
If only I could give it another try …
He had an affair with Rob!
…
…
Audrey … That’s getting kind of creepy. You didn’t kill him, did you?
…
Miss?!
I guess it’s too late to make a run for it now, isn’t it?
You killed your husband?!
You. Filthy. Bitch!
I saw you. You know … every time when you thought I wasn’t at home?
Your ‘husband’ needed someone to talk to! That’s something you never did!
When I came home on Friday and saw him … or her or …{w=0.5} {i}IT{/i}, I had to make him pay for what he did to me.
What does that mean?
Rob was already gone, but my husband was obviously still in his perverted, little dream world.
Thinking about dresses and nail polish!
I see … The lipstick stain on the glass … It all makes sense now.
You really killed him because he dressed up as a girl?
He was out of his mind. Wearing dresses …! What kind of man does such things?
I should’ve delivered him from his sins years ago!
You don’t understand anything, do you?! Do you even realize what you did to her, all those years?!
Her?! You were lucky that you haven’t been there! I would have killed you, too!
Have you {i}ever{/i} even {i}tried{/i} to understand what she’s going through?
Stop it! Miss, I’m going to arrest you. You have the right to remain silent.
You needed one try to find the murderer!
Congratulations! Way to go, {b}Sherlock{/b}!
You needed [tries] tries to find the murderer!
{b}Greenhorn{/b}. At least you tried, right?
That was okay for a {b}beginner{/b}.
Nice job, {b}detective{/b}!
Congratulations! You are a {b}guardian{/b}!
She confessed.
But she regretted nothing. She believed that she released her from her sins.
Audrey did not even realize that her husband was transsexual.
Her ignorance killed that young woman.
She was always so reclusive because her wife prohibited her to be herself.
What a mess. I’d have never guessed that the case would end that way.
Talking about a black swan event.
It’s a sin to kill a Black Swan. Black Swans just want to be accepted, but often they are outcasts.
When will everyone realize that the world is not just white swans?
The world is colorful. And we are all human.
That case got me thinking …
And it made me realize something important.
He had an affair with Cain!
Uhm …
Everyone knows Cain is obsessed with {i}me{/i}!
That’s …! You know?!
Besides, Cain is not gay and neither was my man.
If only you knew …
You want to say something?
Forget it.
Detective, I think it would be best if you’d leave now.
I failed.
But I was on the right track!
What was I missing?
If only I could give it another try …
You envied him.
{i}I{/i} envied {i}him{/i}?
My husband was an antisocial lone wolf without a job.
{i}I{/i} earned the money, he had nothing. He stayed at home all day.
{i}I{/i} have friends, he had only me! Why should I envy him?
Why do you speak so ill of him?
I-I don’t!
Anyway, your reasoning is flawed. It’s obvious you’re only making wild guesses.
…
I failed.
Was it her, after all …?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If only I could give it another try …
It was an accident.
An accident? You just said it was an act out of revenge!
You’re contradicting yourself, Detective.
An accident? You mean, {i}I{/i} accidentally {i}pushed{/i} my husband out of the window?
Well, when you say it like that …
You said it was murder, but you don’t seem to have any proof.
…
I failed.
Was it her, after all …?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If only I could give it another try …
Ellen is the murderer!
You don’t really think that, do you?
Actually …
You’re the detective. So tell me, what was my motive?
You killed him out of pride. I know your attitude towards Audrey.
You wanted to get back at her and prove that you are superior!
Do you really think that makes sense?
Me killing a friend because I wanted to ‘get back at her’?
Wouldn’t it make more sense to kill her, then?
Now that you mention it …
Listen, I appreciate your work, but maybe this case is just too hard for you.
…
I failed.
Was it her, after all …?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If only I could give it another try …
You were angry at him. You sneaked into his house and killed him.
Ah, okay. And {i}why{/i} was I angry?
Uhm … I don’t know.
He was a good friend of mine. Even if I’d been angry, I wouldn’t have killed him.
I see.
Don’t get me wrong. I think you are a great detective, but this could just be too hard for you.
…
I failed.
Was it her, after all …?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If only I could give it another try …
Rob is the murderer!
Really, I am?
Yes!
I really thought you got this, Detective. And my motive?
You killed him out of anger!
Anger? I wasn’t angry at him.
You know he called me to come over on Friday.
We had a nice time.
Besides, I wouldn’t just kill because I’m angry!
Well …
No! I don’t want to hear anything from you!
You just make everything worse!
…
I failed.
It wasn’t him! Was it?
He seemed to be so emotional about it.
If only I could give it another try …
You killed him because you were envious!
In what way?
You envied his lifestyle and his money.
I know it is hard, but I love my night club.
If I wanted money, I just could have asked him.
But …
No, please. Don’t make this even more embarrassing for you.
…
I failed.
It wasn’t him! Was it?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If only I could give it another try …
You killed him because you were greedy!
Pardon?
That’s right. You wanted to inherit his money!
You knew he’d mention you in his will because you were his best friend.
I would never kill because of money! I would never kill at all!
Also, I’m pretty sure my husband didn’t left a will.
Oh.
That’s right, {i}Detective{/i}. Oh.
I’m sorry.
Maybe you should leave that case to someone else.
…
I failed.
It wasn’t him! Was it?
I should have thought about all of the evidence I got.
If I could only try it again …
It was an accident.
Huh?
You pushed him out of the window after you drunk wine.
That’s …
Do you confess?
No. I was at his house. And, yes, we did drink wine.
But he was alive when I left!
…
…
You cannot prove it, anyway. Maybe you should give up!
…
I failed.
It wasn’t him! Was it?
Seemed like I was right about something, though!
If only I could give it another try …
You are all murderers!
Detective?
W-what does that mean?
You have to be more concrete.
All of us? Five people broke into my house and killed my man? Including {i}me{/i}?
I’m not sure you know what you’re saying, Detective.
With all due respect, you didn’t really t-think that through, did you?
…
Figures. He doesn’t know shit.
Sarah!
Yeah, maybe you’re right. I have no clue.
I failed.
I know they are all involved, but …
I’m sure one of them murdered him!
If only I could give it another try …
None of you did it!
Wait, didn’t you just say we all ‘played an important role’?
Are you even in your right mind?
Detective, maybe you overworked yourself.
I-I’m not sure what I was thinking.
Seems like it.
S-so you don’t actually know who did it?
*sigh* And I already got my hopes up.
Sorry …
I failed.
One of them {i}did{/i} it!
I should have had enough clues to figure out who it was!
If I could only try it again …
I am the murderer!
…
Is that some sick joke?
You’re so tactless! A man died and you’re making jokes!
I … I didn’t really want to say that!
M-maybe someone else should take care of this case. {w=0.5}J-just saying.
I’m out of here! This is getting ridiculous.
I failed.
What was I even thinking?!
Of course, I didn’t kill him!
If only I could give it another try …
