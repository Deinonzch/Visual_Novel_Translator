"January 2011, 4:00 P.M."
"A game by\nMarcel Weyers{p=4.0}{nw}"
"The train comes to a stop. Haru is the first one to step out of the car and I follow him."
"So, where is your house?"
"This way. Follow me."
"We walk in silence to my home. It's not very far from the train station."
"It's really quiet here."
"Yeah, please be quiet too, okay?"
"That's basically the only rule here."
"Okay, I'll remember this."
"Follow me, my room's on the second floor."
"So, this is your room?"
"He enters my room and looks around."
"This place is so nice. I really like it."
"I thank him for his kind words."
"You're welcome. Working with you here won't be as much of a pain as I thought it would be."
"Oh, I mean...it's not like I thought working with you would be a pain. It's just...well..."
"I'm not really used to do something for school."
"I know how he meant it. I just hope he doesn't let me do all the work."
"I want to finish this school project quickly and not waste the whole weekend working on it."
"I don't like it when someone comments on my room."
"It's just a room, after all."
"Sorry... I was just trying to be nice."
"No big deal, really."
"Well, let's just finish this school project."
"Haru is a classmate. Usually he'd do this project with his best friend Yusaku, but..."
"I still can't believe Yusaku is working with Midori on this project. I mean... it's obvious he just teamed up with her because of her knowledge."
"Weren't {i}you{/i} the first one who begged her to work with you?"
"I didn't!"
"Whatever. We really should get started with this."
"Yeah! The sooner we finish this the better."
"A few hours later..."
"{i}:sigh:{/i} We still have a lot to do."
"I know. Let's call it a day and finish the rest tomorrow."
"Yeah, this is probably the best idea. Although, I really wished I could enjoy the weekend."
"I know! Let's at least enjoy the evening. Wait a moment, I'll go and get something to eat."
"There are some sweets in the kitchen, you can take them."
"Great!"
"Haru is a nice guy but he really could have done more for this project."
"Well, at least I didn't have to do everything on my own."
"Ooookay..."
"Haru? Did you turn off the lights?"
"Maybe it's a blackout?"
"It has to be."
"I turn around to look for Haru..."
"But he has already entered the room again."
"Seems like there's a storm coming. I just saw every light in the street go out when I looked out of the window."
"Well, there's nothing we can do about it..."
"We could watch a movie on my notebook, I guess."
"Is the battery charged enough?"
"I think so, it should be enough for a short movie."
"At least this lamp runs on batteries."
"I sit down on my bed and look over Haru's shoulders."
"He minimizes a web page and starts a movie. Then he sits down next to me."
"I hope you like horror movies."
"Hahaha. Really? Don't be such a mollycoddle."
"He doesn't listen to me and lets the movie play anyway."
"Yay! That's the spirit!"
"The movie doesn't seem to have a plot...it's just blood splattering everywhere."
"I'm actually feeling a little ill."
"It's getting late and I'm starting to doze off."
"I have a nightmare."
"I can't breathe! Someone's suffocating me!"
"I struggle and manage to open my eyes."
"11:30 P.M."
"I wake up to the pouring rain and know immediately that something is wrong."
"I glance to the side and find the bed empty."
"Where is he?"
"The only thing I hear, besides the rain, is the persistent buzzing from the notebook."
"Maybe I should look around."
"We used this book for research. It was actually quite helpful."
"Haru's notebook is still running. He brought it here. I shouldn't touch it."
"There are some school books from Haru. Some of them look like they weren't used at all. Haru is such a lazy boy when it comes to school stuff!"
"The rain is pouring. I can't remember the last time it was raining so heavily."
"There are just some of my clothes in it."
"The bed is empty. Where is Haru?"
"The lamp is turned off."
"Huh? There's something scribbled on it."
"\"Don't close your eyes.\""
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"\"Don't close your eyes.\""
"It's just a poster."
"Those are my jackets."
"Hm... what's in this box?"
"It's a comfortable cushion."
"It's a picture of..."
"Wait! Why is there a picture of Haru in it?"
"When I think about it, Haru is actually kinda cute."
"I probably forgot that I put a picture of him in there."
"Did he change this picture? That's so creepy."
"It's a picture of Haru."
"Are you done exploring?"
"I just found this weird note..."
"I didn't find anything useful."
"What was that sound?"
"I head for the door."
"It is locked!"
"Haru? Are you there? Please open the door."
"There's no answer. I guess I'm stuck in here."
"Is this a nightmare? Who the hell locked the door?"
"And why?"
"I can't even remember having a key for my room."
"What was that?"
"What's going on here?"
"Haru?"
"Are you here in this room?"
"Did I really expect an answer?"
"I have to do something!"
"There's is nothing useful."
"Wait. This web page... It's about vampires?"
"I didn't know Haru's into this vampire stuff..."
"These vampire pictures are actually pretty scary..."
"There are some school books from Haru. Some of them look like they haven't been used at all. Haru is such a lazy boy when it comes to school stuff!"
"I could escape through the window..."
"It's actually quite high...I will break some of my bones if I jump."
"I open the window."
"The rain is ice cold and the wind is freezing."
"I close my eyes and jump."
"You feel the wind in your face. Then the sudden collision with the ground. You can't move and you realize that your legs are broken. Unable to withstand the pain, you lose consciousness."
"The next morning Haru finds you. He takes you to the hospital, but it is already too late. You are hypothermic and your injury is too serious. Your heart stops beating a few hours later."
"The police can't find anything that might have driven you to jump. Your death is labeled as suicide."
"You are dead."
"Ending 3 of 10: Jump To Death."
"I wouldn't survive a jump like this. It was a silly idea."
"The noise seems to come from this drawer..."
"I don't know if it is a good idea to open it."
"When you open the drawer, a dark hand grabs you on your collar. Its sharp fingernails pierce your skin. The pain is too much. You can't even scream. When the dark creature pulls you into the drawer, you feel your bones breaking."
"You'll never know what this creature is. When the sun rises, Haru finds the room empty. He cannot find neither you, nor the school stuff you brought with you. He figures you left your home early."
"The next day your parents report you missing. However, the police never find you. Not even a clue of where you could be. After a month, everyone gives up looking for you."
"You are dead."
"Ending 2 of 10: The Monster In The Drawer."
"It's better to leave it closed."
"The bed won't help me much."
"The lamp is still turned off."
"Huh? There's something scribbled on it."
"\"Don't close your eyes.\""
"What is that supposed to mean?"
"\"Don't close your eyes.\""
"It's just a poster."
"Those are my jackets."
"Hm... what's in this box?"
"It's a comfortable cushion."
"It's a picture of..."
"Wait! Why is there a picture of Haru in it?"
"When I think about it Haru is actually kinda cute."
"I probably forgot that I put a picture of him in there."
"Did he change this picture? That's so creepy."
"It's a picture of Haru."
"Are you done exploring?"
"This is ridiculous. There is no reason I should stay up. I better go back to sleep."
"After you close your eyes you feel a terrible pain in your stomach. You open your eyes in shock, you can see a silhouette but it's too blurry to see anything clearly. You recognize the sharp claws of the monster as they pierce through your body -- but it's already too late."
"You'll never know what this creature is. As the sun rises, Haru finds the room empty. He cannot find neither you, nor the school stuff you brought with you. He figures you left early."
"The next day your parents report you missing. However, the police never find you. Not even a clue where you could be. After a month, everyone gives up looking for you."
"You are dead."
"Ending 1 of 10: Don't Close Your Eyes."
"I didn't find something that could help me."
"There was this sound again!"
"Ha-Haru! What happened to you?"
"Seems like you discovered my little secret."
"Hahaha... Nice try. I was really scared for a moment."
"So, take off this white make up and go to bed now."
"Those contacts look pretty scary..."
"Haru?"
"In the blink of an eye he races towards you and sinks his teeth into your neck. You feel the blood running down your collarbone. You cannot believe this... your body is paralyzed and the room goes blurry."
"The last thing you see is Haru's bloody smirk as he lets go of you. Your body collapses to the ground and the world fades away into darkness."
"The next day your parents report you missing. Although the police investigate, they never find your body."
"You are dead."
"Ending 4 of 10: Vampire Attack."
"What now?"
"I scream as loud as I can."
"But the moment I open my mouth something hits me."
"When you look down and see the huge spear which pierced your body, you know it's too late. Someone...or rather something killed you. Your body goes into shock and you cannot turn around to see your murderer."
"The last thing you see are your blood-smeared hands as you collapse to the ground. You should've known that ignoring your own rule would be a bad idea."
"Your parents and the police look for you a long time...but they never find you."
"You are dead."
"Ending 5 of 10: Be Quiet."
"Something is terribly wrong here. I have no other choice. I have to break through the door to escape."
"On three..."
"1... 2... 3!"
"The door opens and I start running."
"I hear this breathing again and I know that someone is chasing me."
"I run as fast as I can."
"I crash into the entrance door and leave the house behind me. The rain splashes on my face."
"I cannot see anything. It is so dark."
"Nevertheless, I keep running."
"The ground under my feet is muddy and I almost fall. I must be in a forest or something."
"I hear the footsteps of my pursuer coming nearer. What should I do?"
"When I look to the left I see some lights in the distance, maybe this is my salvation."
"On the right side, however, is a yawning chasm. I think there's a big lake at the bottom. Maybe I could jump?"
"No time to think about this any longer! I have to make a decision. NOW!"
"One last try!"
"After a few minutes I hear something in the bushes next to me."
"I'm out of breath, I cannot run any longer..."
"Suddenly, a huge animal leaps out of the bushes."
"You cannot move. It's obvious that this wolf is not a normal one. It's much too big and its fangs are huge. When it sinks its teeth into your leg, you wonder if this monster is also venomous. You try to scream, but it's impossible due to the pain and the fear."
"The only thing you see is blood, as the wolf tears your body apart. First your legs, then your arms. Finally he ends your pain by ripping your head off."
"No one finds your body."
"You are dead."
"Ending 9 of 10: Animal Attack."
"I don't know if it's a good idea..."
"But I don't know what I should do."
"I'm breathing heavily..."
"This running is no good."
"I'm not surprised when I'm at the starting point again."
"I don't give up!"
"This forest has to end somewhere!"
"This can't be!"
"I'm at the same place again."
"I try to run again."
"But it is no use... I'm ending up at the same place once again."
"I decide to keep running. I have no time to think about any other ways."
"However, it seems like I'm running around in circles..."
"There must be an end to this forest!"
"After a few minutes I am at the same place like before."
"Those lights might be my only chance. There must be people somewhere."
"I fight my way through the trees and the bushes."
"The train station!"
"I feel relieved and rush into the station building."
"It is no use. There are lights on, but no one is in there."
"My time is running out! I hear my pursuer right behind me and start running again."
"I run over the rails and the only thing I can think about-{p=0.3}{nw}"
"You don't even have the time to wonder why there's a train in the middle of the night in such a small village. The impact crushes your body and the train doesn't stop. You lose consciousness after a few seconds."
"There is a big search operation, but nobody finds your body. After a few months everyone gave up looking for you."
"You are dead."
"Ending 6 of 10: Train Run."
"Sooner or later you have to face your fears! I cannot run away all the time."
"The dark creature emerges from behind the trees."
"But when I see the familiar face..."
"Haru?"
"What are you doing here?"
"I followed you when you rushed out of the house."
"I thought..."
"Are you a sleepwalker?"
"He grins."
"Haha... yeah, I guess so..."
"Okay, is everything alright? We should go back home."
"You're right. It's pretty cold out here."
"Suddenly there's a bright white light."
"And when I open my eyes again..."
"I'm back?"
"I cannot believe my eyes."
"When I look to the side I see Haru sleeping in the bed."
"I guess this was just a really bad dream."
"Everything is back to normal."
"You are alive."
"Ending 10 of 10: Bad Dream."
"True Ending"
"You needed 1 try to reach the true ending."
"You needed [plays] tries to reach the true ending."
"My heart almost stops beating when I see this abnormity."
"I want to say something."
"Just some words. To show him I'm not afraid. That I'm not a coward..."
"But he is too fast."
"You have no time to do something. The monster already crushed your skull. You wished Haru was there. Maybe you should have been nicer to him. He may could have helped you."
"You are dead."
"Ending 8 of 10: Not A Coward."
"This is it! He wouldn't follow me down there."
"I close my eyes and take a deep breath."
"Then I jump."
"You feel the wind in your face and you start to wonder if there's even an end to this chasm when suddenly your body hits the ground. Unfortunately, you missed the lake and crashed into a pile of sharp stones. Your body bursts into a million pieces as every bone shatters."
"The police only need a few days until they find your wrecked body. Haru does not know why you left your house and at the end your death is labeled as suicide."
"You are dead."
"Ending 7 of 10: Cliff Diving."
