"It was the summer before I started college. I had spent the past two years studying, taking tests, and applying for admission."
"Now, for the first time in a while, I had a little downtime. So I decided to take the opportunity to explore America."
"But, since I was broke, my plans were quickly scaled down to spending the summer at my aunt and uncle's house, on a small island known as North Sand Island."
"North Sand Island was a barrier island in the Atlantic ocean. It was remote enough that there wasn't even a bridge to it, just a ferry that ran a few times a day."
"Being such a small island, there wasn't all that much to do. But the solitude was nice, and I found ways to pass the time."
"One thing I did was to take pictures with my digital camera. On the night of the full moon, I decided that I wanted to capture the moonrise."
"So I went out to the beach just before the moon came up, set up my camera on a tripod, and locked in the appropriate shutter speed and f-stop."
"Every few seconds as the moon rose, I used the remote that came with my camera to snap another frame showing the moon and its reflection in the water."
"It only took a few minutes for the moon to rise over the horizon, but I kept at it for a while longer."
"Finally, I was done. I started packing up my camera and my tripod, to get ready to head back to my aunt and uncle's house."
"That's when I first saw her. In the distance, I could see someone else walking down the beach."
"I could tell that it was probably a girl or a woman from the long white dress she wore, but from that distance it was hard to tell anything else about her."
"I decided to stay a bit to see who it was. In all the times I've gone out stargazing, I'd never met anyone just walking down the beach in the middle of the night."
"At that late hour, most people were either at home, or in a town with other people. You hardly ever saw people by themselves."
"The only time I've seen someone else on the beach at night would be when they are watching the stars or the satellites go by."
"But those people stay still and look up at the sky, while this girl was looking down at the ground in front of her, watching where she was going."
"I ran through a number of crazy scenarios in my head. Maybe she had some disease that meant she couldn't be out in the sun. Maybe she was looking for buried treasure."
"It only took me a few seconds to dismiss these. What was the chance of them actually happening?"
"I waited for a while, as she slowly made her way down the beach. I didn't think such a slow walk could be for exercise, but I had no idea what else she could be doing out there."
"Finally, she was close enough that I could get a good look at her, using the telephoto lens on my camera."
"She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. She was around my age, a year or two younger or older at the most, and in perfect shape."
"Her skin was flawless, if a bit pale, and her hair was very light, almost as white as the long dress she was wearing."
"Together, the combination of pale skin, light hair, and a white dress made her seem to glow in the moonlight."
"She was a fair ways off, and I was pretty sure that she hadn't seen me. I knew what it was I wanted to do."
"I knew that I wanted to take her picture."
"I knew that I needed to talk to her."
"I thought I would be a failure as a photographer if I let such a beautiful sight go without capturing it, so I readied my camera to take her picture."
"I didn't let her know I was there. It's best to take pictures of unaware people, because if they know you're taking their picture, they tend to pose unnaturally."
"I set the camera to auto, framed her in the picture, and pressed the shutter release button. The camera beeped softly as it captured the picture."
"I repeated this a dozen times. I find that it helps to take many pictures, in the hopes that one or two of them will come out perfectly."
"When I was done taking the pictures, I lowered my camera and waved to her."
"After a few seconds, she finally noticed me and waved back."
"But she was still far enough away that if I had tried talking to her, my voice would have been lost over the crash of the waves."
"I put my camera back into its case, picked up the tripod, and started heading back to my aunt and uncle's house."
"When I got back, I hooked the camera up to my computer, and started downloading the pictures I took that night."
"The series of photographs of the moon came out well, but they weren't really what I was interested in."
"I quickly skipped through them, looking for the pictures I took of the girl."
"But when I finally got to the pictures I took of her, there was something strange about them."
"She wasn't there."
"I'm almost certain that I had framed the pictures right, but all I saw in them was the sandy beach behind where she was standing."
"There were a dozen pictures like this. Each of them had the background of the shot I had framed, but the subject was nowhere to be seen."
"I must have spent an hour slowly cycling through the pictures I took of the girl, hoping in vain that she would show up in at least one of them."
"But she was never there."
"The combination of her mysterious beauty and the strangeness of those pictures imprinted her image on my mind."
"Even today, years later, I can close my eyes, think back, and see her as I saw her through my lens that day."
"I went stargazing at that beach several times over the summer, hoping that I would be able to see her again."
"But I never did."
"No Dialogue"
"Nothing to Say"
"As the girl was walking this way, I decided the best thing to do was to put my camera away and wait for her to come closer."
"I didn't want to scare her away by running towards her, or to have to shout over the ocean waves."
"After I had patiently waited for what must have been twenty minutes, she was finally close enough that I could talk to her in a reasonable voice."
"Hello."
"Maybe it wasn't the most eloquent of lines, but it was all I could think of at the time, and it got the job done."
"She stopped, and looked at me, as if waiting for me to say something else."
"It's a nice night. It's warm, but not really all that hot."
"She nodded at this, but didn't say anything. I finally decided to cut to the chase and ask her the question on my mind."
"So what are you doing out here?"
"Walking."
"Just... walking? In the middle of the night?"
"Yes."
"Are you going anywhere in particular?"
"I walk around the island, following the beaches."
"The island wasn't that big. I could go around it in a few hours, maybe a little more if I stopped for a break. I'd have no problems keeping up with her."
"Mind if I walk with you?"
"If that's what you want."
"I decided that I'd bring my camera with me, but I hid my tripod and bag in the dunes."
"This took only a few seconds, and we quickly started walking down the beach."
"We walked in silence for a while, until we could no longer see where we started."
"I looked back anyway, and saw only our footprints breaking up the sand of the beach."
"Walking was great, but I needed to try talking to this girl. I decided to see if I could find out why she was out at night."
"So..."
"She stopped, and looked at me."
"Is there a reason why we're walking down the beach at night?"
"It's something to do."
"I see. Do you do this often?"
"It seems like I do this every day."
"Do you always walk alone, or do other people come with you?"
"Usually, I'm walking by myself. But once in a while, I meet someone else, and sometimes they decide to walk with me."
"It's only happened a few times, though, and I don't think that anyone has asked as many questions as you."
"I didn't know how to take this, and we stood in silence for a second."
"Finally, she let out a small laugh, smiled, and took the initiative."
"What were you doing out there?"
"I didn't think that she was interested in me, and so it took me a second to respond to her question."
"Seeing my hesitation, she elaborated."
"I think we both agree that it's rare to meet someone else out on the beach this time of night. So what were you doing there?"
"It took me another second to think back to what I was doing, but finally I answered her."
"I'm into astronomy... well, stargazing, really. I was out taking digital photos of the moon as it rose."
"She looked at me questioningly, as if she didn't know what I was talking about. I found that a little odd, as I thought everyone knew what a digital camera was."
"I decided to show her my camera."
"I decided that the easiest way to explain was to show her some of the pictures I had taken, and so I pulled my camera out of its case, and turned it on."
"I switched it to displaying pictures, and called up one of the last pictures I had taken, one which showed the full disk of the moon."
"I held up the camera to the girl, to let her see the picture on its screen."
"She took a good look at it, turned to take a look at the moon in the sky, and then took another long look at the screen."
"The moon is... It's so small."
"I didn't know what exactly she was trying to get at here."
"The pictures are small here, but they look much bigger on the computer screen."
"I tried explaining, but it just seemed to confuse her even more, so I decided to change the topic."
"I decided to show her the moon."
"I was really into astronomy when I was young. I could look up at the moon and name all of the seas."
"Really?"
"Well, I can't do it anymore. But I still remember where one of the seas is."
"I point up to the moon, and she turns to take a look at it."
"Take a look at the right side of the moon. If you look, you can see what looks like a boy, with a head, body, and two legs."
"Do you see it?"
"I see it!"
"She seemed excited by this, as if she had never looked at the moon like this before. Maybe she hadn't."
"People look at the moon in different ways. Some people see a man, others a boy and a girl, others a rabbit."
"Well, if you look at his body, that's the sea of tranquility, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked."
"Buzz? Like the sound?"
"Well, his real name was Edwin. But everyone called him Buzz. I don't know why."
"She didn't say anything, for a few seconds, as she took this in."
"So there are people walking around on the moon?"
"Not anymore. We sent the last people in the seventies, and nobody has been back there since."
"So we sent them?"
"Yes. Every man on the moon was an American."
"She smiled at this, as if she had just found out and taken great satisfaction in this fact."
"I thought it was odd, though, that she hadn't heard of the moon landings. I had though everyone learned about them when they were young."
"Still, it gave me a sense of satisfaction to be the person that told her about them."
"I decided that I would change the topic to something I was sure that she could talk about."
"Did you grow up around here?"
"I did."
"When I was growing up, there weren't all these houses and buildings on the island."
"The only things on the island were farms, and the farms were huge."
"Only four families lived here, and between us we owned all the land on the island."
"My family was one of the four. We owned the southern end of the island, where we first met."
"We hadn't cleared all of our land, but we had a large enough farm that we could grow the food we needed and sell some at market."
"I didn't know that the island's population was so small, so recently. I knew that tourism could grow a population... but so quickly?"
"Did you go to school on the mainland, then?"
"Once in a while. When we took the ferry over to sell our produce, we would spend a few days in the school being tested."
"But most of the time, we were homeschooled."
"Mama would teach us reading and writing, and Papa would teach us math and things."
"At least, before they died..."
"With this, her smile went away. It was obvious that this was a hard subject for her to talk about."
"I asked her about her parents."
"I dropped the subject."
"What can you tell me about your parents?"
"Papa and Mama both came across the ocean as settlers when they were just children."
"Papa fought in the war. When it was over, he married Mama, and they used his pension to move here from the mainland, and to build us a house."
"Together, they farmed the land, and eventually they had children."
"I had an older sister and a younger sister. I was the middle child."
"She paused for a second to collect her thoughts before continuing. This part was taking a strain on her."
"When I was ten, an epidemic hit the island."
"We came down with it, and so did all of the other families."
"My family was too sick to move, but our neighbors, the Millers, sent some of their boys to get help from the mainland."
"I remember thinking that Miller was the last name of my aunt and uncle, and wondering if they could be related to me."
"I don't know what happened to them, but I never heard from them again."
"It lasted a week, and than it was over. My sisters... my parents... they all..."
"Now I'm the only one left."
"I'm sorry."
"I didn't know what else to say to a girl that had lost her family, and was obviously broken up about it."
"She nodded in response, wiped her tears, and we once again started walking in silence."
"It looked like if I asked her to continue, she would break out in tears. So I decided to let it go, and instead just started walking down the beach again."
"I don't know how much time passed until we spoke again. Maybe it was an hour, maybe less, maybe longer."
"We slowly made our way around the island, with me walking a few feet behind her."
"If it had been someone else, I probably would have taken my leave and headed back for home."
"But there was something about this girl that made me want to stay with her."
"An aura, of some sort. Of beauty? Of tragedy? Of loneliness? Perhaps some combination of all of them, and more."
"And so, we kept silently walking down the moonlit beach."
"Finally, I couldn't take it any more, and I tried once again to strike up a conversation."
"So... is there anything you want to do with your life?"
"For a few seconds, she said nothing, as if I had said something wrong."
"But then, she began to speak."
"Once, I thought I knew."
"When I was younger, it was like my life was planned out for me already. I would follow in my mother's footsteps."
"I'd help out on the farm for a few years. Even when we were young, we had chores, but when we finished our schooling we could help out even more."
"Eventually, I'd meet a nice boy. I didn't know who, at the time... Thinking back, it probably would have been one of the Miller boys. They were around my age."
"We would get married, and start a farm of our own."
"We'd raise a family together. A few girls, and I always wanted a boy, because all I had was sisters."
"Now, however..."
"Her smile vanished as she let the thought trail off. After a little while, she changed the subject back to me."
"What about you? What do you plan to do in the future?"
"Her question took me a little off guard, both because I wasn't expecting her to ask me the same thing, and because I'd never really thought much about my future."
"She smiled a little at my obvious confusion."
"Well, I'm spending this summer visiting with my family. When it's over, I'll be going off to school."
"Aren't you a little old to still be in school?"
"Well, state school... I'm going to be attending a university in the fall."
"I don't know what I'll do after that... I don't even know what classes I'll be taking, or exactly what my major will be."
"I figure that when I'm not at school, I'll be living with my parents for a while."
"Eventually, I'll get a job and move out."
"As to settling down and starting a family... well, I have no idea about when that's going to happen."
"I haven't really thought much about it yet. I don't think many people have their lives as well planned as you."
"I think most people are just sort of winging it."
"At this, she let out a quiet laugh."
"Is there something wrong with that?"
"No, no, nothing at all. In fact, I think I envy you."
"Why?"
"Well, you can do anything you want with your life. You can go anywhere you want."
"Some people would think that having too many choices is some sort of curse, or a burden."
"But I think it's just freedom, and that's a good thing."
"I think it's nice to live a life where your future is open, where you can do anything you want."
"Once again, I didn't know what to say, and for a second I thought we'd go back to walking in silence."
"But instead of letting the conversation falter, she kept it going."
"What do you do for fun?"
"Lots of things. I like drawing, listening to music, and watching cartoons and football on TV."
"Foot...ball?"
"She repeated the term slowly, as if she knew both words, but had never heard them together in that way before."
"Yeah, football. You know, the sport... you've heard of it, right?"
"She shook her head to indicate that she hadn't."
"How can I begin to describe it?"
"There are two teams on the field at once, and one of them has the ball. The center hikes the ball to the quarterback."
"The quarterback can either throw the ball to another player, hand it to another guy, or try to run with it."
"Everything I said seemed to confuse her even more. But I didn't know what else to do, so I just kept on going."
"The other team tries to stop them by tackling the player with the ball. If they can't move the ball 10 yards in 4 downs, then the other team gets it..."
"It was around this part of my explanation that she broke out giggling. Now that I look back on it, my explanation was sort of absurd."
"And so, we passed the night talking about things."
"Mostly, I talked, and she listened. Sometimes she would ask me questions, and I would answer them as best I could."
"Many times, that wouldn't be good enough, and she would break out laughing as I fumbled through another explanation."
"We spent the rest of the night like this, talking and laughing as we made our way around the island."
"By dawn, we had made it almost all the way around the island, to a cliff not far from where we had first met."
"The girl started to climb back down to the beach below, but I stopped her."
"I thought we could stay here and watch the sun come up."
"To my surprise, her reaction to my explanation was one of shock."
"It's sunrise already? I have to be going!"
"This came as a surprise to me. We had been getting along well, and now she was about to run off."
"She must have seen the disappointment on my face, as she changed her tone as she elaborated."
"It... it's not you, I like... it's just that I... I can't."
"I understand."
"I said, not really understanding anything."
"As she started walking away, I searched my mind to see if there was anything I could say to keep her there just a little longer."
"Suddenly, I realized that there was something I had forgotten to ask her."
"What is your name?"
"I realized that throughout the entire night, I had never asked her what her name was. A bad habit of mine is that I can have whole conversations without knowing someone's name."
"So I asked her, almost shouting the question to her."
"She stopped walking, turned back to me, and smiled."
"It's Mary... Mary Harper!"
"When can I see you again?"
"I realized I didn't know when I could see her again. Without knowing that, I'd probably never see her again."
"She paused for a second, thinking, and then finally told me."
"You can meet me again on the night of the next full moon."
"The next full moon? That's not for almost a month. Can't we meet before then?"
"I'm sorry... that's just the next time..."
"I understand. I'll be there, where we first met!"
"At that moment, the sun cleared the horizon. Its brilliance blinded me, and I reflexively closed my eyes."
"I've seen the sunrise many times, before and since, but I've never seen it as bright as it was that time."
"When I opened my eyes again, the girl was gone."
"I didn't know why she went, how she had left so quickly, or where she had gotten off to."
"The one thing I did know was that I wanted to meet her again."
"Having found out her name, I proceeded to look her up on the web."
"Of course, the name \"Mary Harper\" gave me thousands of hits."
"But after I narrowed it down to the local area, I got nothing at all."
"According to the online phonebook, no one named \"Harper\" lived on the island."
"After getting some sleep, I went to the library to try to find out more about her."
"Knowing she said that she was from around here, I took out a book on the history of North Sand Island."
"I figured that a family being wiped out by disease would be worth recording."
"The only thing I found when I looked up \"Harper\" in the book was the story of a Harper family that lived on the island in the 1780s."
"They were wiped out by an epidemic that killed almost everyone on the island in 1790. Only a few boys escaped to tell the tale."
"It left the island empty, and it wasn't until after the civil war that people settled here again."
"It's eerie how similar their situation was to what happened to Mary."
"A father, mother, and three daughters, all wiped out by disease."
"Along with everyone else on the island."
"But, of course, it had to be a coincidence, since it happened over two centuries ago."
"I couldn't find anything newer than that, and eventually gave up."
"I looked through the book, and through the records of people living on the island after it was resettled."
"Despite hours of searching, I couldn't find anyone named Harper."
"That night, I went out to the beach where I first saw her, hoping to meet her again."
"I spent the entire night there, but she didn't show up."
"I tried again the next night, and the night after that. Every night for two weeks."
"But after that first night, I never saw her again."
"And I never forgot her, either."
"History"
"It takes twenty-nine days for the moon to go from full to new to full again, and that's how long I had to wait before I could see her again."
"It would have made for a really good story if I could have said I spent that entire time thinking about her, but that's not the way life works."
"I'm sure I did other things, that month, but looking back I can hardly remember them."
"I did spend quite a bit of time thinking about her, remembering her smile and her laugh."
"Kicking myself for forgetting to ask her name."
"Constantly checking and re-checking the exact moment of the full moon, to be sure that I showed up on the right night."
"And finally, it was that night, and I found myself once again standing out on the beach, looking up at the moon."
"Were you waiting long?"
"I turned, and found her standing next to me."
"I wasn't really expecting you to be here. It's rare that I get to see someone a second time."
"Hey, I said I was going to be here, didn't I?"
"You did."
"I'm the type of guy who keeps his word. When I say I'm going to be somewhere, I'll be there."
"Besides, a guy would have to be crazy not to come back to see you again."
"Or did you not hear what I said? You left in an awful hurry last time. I didn't even get a chance to ask your name."
"Mary."
"It's Mary Harper."
"Well, Mary Harper, it's good to see you again, after almost an entire month."
"It's good to see you, too, but for me it feels like we were together only yesterday."
"I didn't exactly pick up what she was saying here, so I just said what I was thinking before."
"I think it was the same way for me. I spent the entire month thinking about you."
"I'm not sure if it's exactly the same... but that's sweet."
"I didn't know what to say after that, and so I didn't say anything."
"Instead I simply motioned down the beach, and we started walking together, down the shore."
"It wasn't long before Mary broke the silence, by asking me a question."
"I told you a little about my family... but I haven't asked you about yours yet. What's your family like?"
"When I'm on the island here, I live with my aunt and uncle, but back home, I live with my mother, father, and sister."
"A sister? Is she older or younger?"
"She's two years younger than me."
"Do you get along with her well?"
"I thought about how to answer this for a second, and decided that honesty was the best policy."
"Not really. We fight like cats and dogs."
"At this, she gave a gentle laugh."
"What do you fight about?"
"Oh, it's never about the same two things. Put the two of us in a room together for a few hours, and all of a sudden, there's something... and we're at it again."
"I was pretty sure I didn't want to keep going on about how my sister and I fought all the time, so I needed to find a way to get out of talking about it."
"How did you get along with your sisters?"
"For a second, I regretted asking that question, remembering how she nearly broke down last time she spoke about her family."
"But this time, she seemed happy to talk about it."
"My sisters and I... we were the best of friends."
"We almost had to be, since our house was so small."
"Until I was seven, we even slept in the same bed."
"But we did everything together. When we had to do chores, we would all help each other out, and we got it done in half the time."
"Did you play together often?"
"We did! Papa built us all a dollhouse, and Mama made us all dolls, and we would play with them together."
"We would play house. Karen would be the father, I would be the mother, and Alice would be our daughter."
"We would sing, and make each other laugh. I haven't laughed like that since..."
"Well, since we met last month."
"I heard the wistful tone in her voice, and decided to drop the subject. We started off again, walking down the beach."
"Look over there!"
"I shouted the first thing that came to mind, and took off running down the beach."
"She followed, chasing after me."
"After a little bit, I slowed down and let her catch me."
"Got you!"
"She said, laughing as she grabbed hold of my shirt."
"And we kept walking, together, down the beach."
"As the night went by, we talked about many things. To be honest, I don't really remember exactly what we said."
"What stayed with me are the sensations."
"The smell of the salt in the sea air."
"The sound of the waves hitting the shore."
"The way the moonlight made her skin glow."
"The feel of the sand as I tripped on a rock and fell."
"The warmth of Mary's hand as she reached out and helped me back up."
"Are you alright?"
"I think so. The sand was soft."
"I'm glad. What did you trip on?"
"I think it was a rock or something."
"I turned to look at where I fell. There were rocks there, enough that it would have been hard to assign any one sole blame."
"Be careful. I wouldn't want you to be hurt."
"I nodded, gave the rocks one last look, and turned to start walking again. But just then, a golden glint hit my eye."
"I went over to where I saw the glint, and started digging. After a few seconds, Mary came over to where I was."
"Did you find something?"
"I don't..."
"I was going to say I didn't know, but I stopped myself. For I had found what I was looking for."
"In my hands was a gold ring. I held it up for Mary to take a look at."
"It's a ring."
"I examined it a little more closely. It was far too light to be made of real gold, and a there were scratches where the gold plating was worn off."
"I held it up so Mary could have a better look at it."
"It's beautiful!"
"It's not real. Someone took a metal ring and plated gold onto it to make it look nicer."
"But it's so pretty."
"If you like it, you can have it."
"Can I?"
"Sure."
"Can you put it on for me?"
"I didn't need to answer this, as she held out her hand. I took it, and slid the ring onto her finger. It was a perfect fit."
"Thank you!"
"With that, she grabbed onto my arm, and together, we started walking down the beach."
"Before we knew it, it was dawn, and we found ourselves in the same place where we parted a month ago."
"Can you stay and watch the sunrise this time?"
"I'm sorry... I can't."
"Well, then when can I see you again?"
"I can only see you on the night of the full moon."
"Even though I thought she might say this, it still hurt a little to hear it. I didn't know how I could go a month without seeing her."
"How come? Why can't I see you before then?"
"Because I'm a ghost."
"She said it as if it was the most obvious thing in the world, as if someone telling you that she's a ghost is something that happens every day."
"Not knowing exactly what to say, I just stood there in silence."
"Eventually, Mary decided to elaborate on this, to tell me her story."
"I became a ghost, after I died... I died, along with my family, in the epidemic that hit this island when I was ten."
"For some reason, I came back on the night of the full moon. I just found myself here on the island."
"I came back on the night of the next full moon, and the next, and as far as I know every one after that. I always come back on the night of the full moon."
"I can do whatever I want that night, but when the sun rises, everything goes dark, and suddenly it's the next month."
"It's been that way for hundreds of years."
"It was boring for a while, but eventually people came back to the island. Once in a while, someone would meet me, like you did."
"We would talk for a while. But most of them were only interested in talking to me because I was a ghost."
"They always went away after a while. I guess there's only so much I can say about it."
"Come to think of it, you never asked me about it. Didn't you figure it out?"
"Of course I knew."
"In retrospect, it was obvious. The way she disappeared with that first sunrise, the way she knew nothing about things everyone alive today knows about..."
"But it took her saying it for me to finally put the pieces together, and begin to accept it."
"I had no idea."
"You didn't? Usually people figure it out on the first night."
"That's the only reason people ever came back. They would come and talk to the ghost, until they lost interest."
"She let out a small laugh, and then seemed to realize something."
"That means... you aren't here because I'm a ghost?"
"You came back because you chose to be with me?"
"Once again, I was speechless, so we stood there for a little while."
"Finally, she broke the silence."
"The sun's almost up, and I need to be going."
"Don't go."
"But..."
"I grabbed her hand, and pulled her close to me."
"Stay with me and watch the sunrise."
"We didn't say anything after that. We just stood there, hand in hand, watching the sky slowly brighten."
"I could feel her left hand in my right, as we stood there looking out over the ocean."
"And then the sun rose, and suddenly my right hand was empty."
"I turned to look, but the girl who was standing there was gone."
"I guess she really is a ghost."
"I said, to no one in particular. She had told me, and I believed her, but until she disappeared, there was still a little bit of doubt."
"I spent the morning standing at that cliff, thinking about it."
"And finally I realized,"
"I had to set her free."
"It didn't really matter."
"I realized that it wasn't natural for someone like Mary to be trapped for hundreds of years as a ghost, condemned to show up only on the night of the full moon."
"And despite my feelings for her, I came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do was to help her find peace."
"I spent the next month doing research in the island's small library."
"I poured through every book they had on the occult. Ghosts, magic, witchcraft... things like that."
"I read two or three books a day."
"When I finished the few books the island's library had, I had them order more from the mainland."
"It got to the point where most of the librarians knew me by name, and the rest knew me by my reputation as the college guy obsessed with the occult."
"The thing with those books was that while most of their content was made up, deep under the surface some contained a small grain of truth."
"The only way I could figure it out was to read everything I could on the subject, and figure out what it all had in common."
"On the night of the next full moon, I was ready to put what I had learned into practice."
"I returned to the spot where we met on the first two nights, and watched the ocean waves slowly rolling in."
"Mary was there, waiting for me."
"You came back."
"I wasn't going to leave you alone, after all that."
"She doesn't say anything to this."
"So, what are we going to do tonight?"
"Usually, I spend the night walking around the island, like we did the other nights."
"I see. So, may I escort you?"
"Of course."
"She grabbed my arm, and we started off on our customary journey around the island."
"We didn't talk as much this time. We didn't need to. Just being in each others presence was enough."
"The chill in the air contrasted with the warmth of her skin."
"Who would have thought that a ghost could be warm?"
"We had a few short conversations, to pass the time."
"But mostly, we walked in silence. The events of last time weighed heavily on us, as if we were both waiting for the other shoe to drop."
"Finally, I couldn't take it anymore and came right out and asked her the question I needed to."
"Mary, is there something you regret never being able to do?"
"The key insight, the kernel of truth that I discovered in all those books was that the thing that makes a ghost is regret."
"What do you mean?"
"I don't know... Is there something you wanted to do, but were never able to?"
"She thought about this for a while."
"Finally, she responded in a barely audible whisper."
"I wanted to be a bride."
"I knew it."
"I had come up with a list of things Mary could possibly regret, and this was on the top of the list."
"She had said her dream was to get married... heck, her dress even looked like a wedding dress."
"I knew that if I loved her, there was only one thing I could do. So I got down on one knee and said,"
"Mary Harper, will you marry me?"
"She was stunned by this... and stood there for a few seconds, saying nothing. Finally, she spoke."
"Are you sure... are you sure you want to marry... me?"
"The most sure that I've ever been."
"Then... Yes!"
"I got up, and we embraced. But she was still a little confused."
"But how can we do it? I can only go out at night, and I don't think that any minister would marry off a ghost."
"Don't worry. We can have a common law marriage."
"Common law?"
"As long as we say we're married, and make vows to each other, it counts."
"Really? So when can we get married?"
"If you're ready, we can do it right now."
"I am!"
"Then let's do this."
"I pulled out of my back pocket a sheet containing wedding vows that I had prepared."
"I changed my voice to sound as if I was some sort of minister, and began reading."
"Do you take this woman to be your wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, as long as you both exist?"
"In my normal voice, I responded,"
"I do."
"I turn to Mary and repeat the vow for her."
"Do you take this man to be your wedded husband, to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, as long as you both exist?"
"I do."
"We stood there for a second, before I finally continued."
"Well, that's it. We're married. All that's left is the kiss."
"She came close to me, and we embraced."
"I closed my eyes, waiting for her lips."
"Thank you."
"I heard her whisper, and I felt the warmth of her lips as they touched mine."
"Then I felt nothing but the cool night air."
"When I opened my eyes, I was alone."
"Ewww!"
"My granddaughter's interruptions stops my telling of the story."
"You kissed someone who wasn't Grandma!"
"You {i}married{/i} someone who wasn't Grandma!"
"Well, that was before I met your grandmother."
"In fact, that's how I first met your grandmother. She was working as an intern at the library."
"And after that, I never saw Mary again."
"She seems unconvinced."
"Was that really a true story?"
"You have my word."
"She thinks about this for a few seconds, before replying."
"I don't believe you. Tell me another story!"
"Not tonight. It's after your bedtime."
"But!"
"No buts, now it's time to get to sleep."
"I turned off the lights, so that she could finally go to bed."
"If I didn't, then my granddaughter would stay up all night, and never go to sleep."
"My granddaughter Mary, whose name I suggested to my son-in-law while we were waiting in the hospital."
"My granddaughter, named for the girl I was married to for a few moments, on a moonlit beach, long ago."
"Married for Moments"
"A month later, I returned to the beach. This time, Mary was waiting for me."
"Hey."
"Welcome back. I suppose you have a few questions to ask me. Everyone always does."
"Not me."
"This stopped her in her tracks."
"You don't have any questions? Doesn't it matter to you what I am?"
"What you are? What do you mean?"
"You know... a ghost."
"That's not what you are to me."
"To me, you're the girl I want to be with. The girl that I love."
"Beyond that, I doesn't matter if you're a ghost or if I'm a leprechaun."
"All of that is unimportant."
"What matters is that you're you, and I'm me, and that we're together."
"With this I started walking down the beach. She must have been too stunned to move, as she stood in one place for a while."
"Finally, I turned to her, and asked:"
"Are you coming?"
"Yes!"
"She cried out her response, and started running after me."
"Together, we set off for another moonlight walk down the beach."
"From that night on, we spent every full moon together."
"I went away to college, but I would always find time to drive down to the island to spend our night together."
"My first job was on the mainland, right across from the island. I would schedule my days off to ensure that I had enough time to get to the beach before Mary appeared."
"Eventually, I saved up enough money to buy a house on the beach, near where we first met."
"I started a software consulting business out of my house. It paid always take time off around the full moon."
"I never missed a night. I would be there, in clear weather and in rain. Once it even snowed, and once I had make my way through a hurricane."
"Mary once said that it was nice to live a life where you could do what you want. Well, I knew what I wanted, and that was to spend my life with her."
"Together, we celebrated my birthday seventy times, and hers twice. We never missed a night together."
"Never, that is, until tonight."
"I'm dying."
"It's not as bad as it sounds. I'm eighty-eight, and I guess it's just my time."
"My heart is giving out, and I've told the doctors not to do anything when it goes."
"Do I have any regrets? Not really."
"Some people might think I would regret not having gotten married and having children."
"But for me, Mary was enough, even if we never actually got married."
"Besides, I used the money I made in my business to put my sister's children and grandchildren through school, and there's enough left that they'll all have a nice inheritance."
"I'll leave the rest to charity. I think that taking care of my family and the world is as good a contribution to posterity as any."
"There is one thing I do regret, and that's that I can't see Mary for one last time tonight."
"It's the night of the full moon, but I'm stuck in this hospital bed, too weak to move on my own."
"The end is near."
"My sense of the world outside myself grows dim, and I focus more and more on my body as it starts to give out."
"I feel my heartbeat growing fainter and fainter."
"Beat ..."
"... Beat ..."
"..."
"......"
"Finally, it stops entirely, and I realize that the end is upon me."
"I was ready to face it alone, but now I realize I don't have to. Mary is standing here with me."
"I don't know why or how... but I do know that she's here."
"What matters is ... that we're together."
"The world becomes white, and I feel the years leaving me."
"Now all I can see is Mary. For some reason she begins walking away from me."
"After a few seconds, she turns back to me and asks:"
"Are you coming?"
"I run to her, and somehow grab her hand."
"Together, we step into the light."
"Together, Into the Light"
