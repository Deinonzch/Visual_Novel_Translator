The icy winter wind blew away all of my drowsiness.
Once again, I go to school.
I don't have to think at school, so it's fun.
“Nii-san!”
“Eh!?”
Kanon suddenly burst out from behind the wall of the apartment.
“Nii-san, you're terrible!”
“Ow!”
She put a death grip on both of my arms.
“What? What on earth are you doing so early in the morning!?”
“What am I doing? Humph, that's what I want to ask you!”
She started pouting unhappily.
“How could you do this, Nii-san!?”
“Okay, okay, I got it! Can you just let go now?”
“What do you mean by ‘you got it’!?”
“What?”
Her eyes seemed to be searching for something.
“...Sorry, I'm clueless.”
“You promised!”
“...Promised...?”
“You really did forget! You promised that you'd come to the skating rink during practice!”
...Ah, now that she mentions it, I guess I did say something to that effect.
“Oh, about that... I'm sorry. Really.”
I'd better come up with a good excuse...
“How do you plan on repaying me? How!?”
“Well, I'm really sorry. I lost my wallet yesterday, and spent all that time looking for it.”
“Oh? Where did you lose it?”
“Central Boulevard.”
“What were you doing there?”
“I was with Tsubaki.”
“Bakii? Why?”
...Bakii is what she calls Tsubaki.
“You don't have to perform a thorough interrogation... we were just hanging out.”
Kanon's mood seems to be worsening with each passing second.
“You could have at least called.”
sorry.”
“I'll forgive you if you pat my head.”
“...Alright.”
No matter what, she'll be happy if she's being petted.
“Hehe...”
In an instant, her surly mood dissipated.
“Good boy, I forgive you.”
The person being patted on the head is saying, ‘Good boy.’
“You're coming to my practice today though, right?”
“I know, I know, I'll definitely be there.”
I'd better remember to do so this time.
“Alright! Let's go to school!”
Kanon stuck to my side naturally.
“Hey, don't latch onto my arm...”
As the weather was slowly getting colder, the Jiyuuga Saki students were wearing warm winter jackets.
“Just listen, Miss Noriko. Let me tell you something...”
After we finally arrived at the school gates, we were greeted by the same scene as yesterday.
“I'm really good at sports!”
Once again, Eiichi is unleashing an attack of love upon our unfortunate Miss Noriko.
...And for the record, I'm pretty sure he sucks at sports.
Christ, Eiichi, you can't just fling out a transparent lie like that.
“Especially surfing.”
...He can't surf at all. What's he going to do, practice until summer?
“(...Hehe. This is what they call a calculated lie. If this lie becomes the truth, then it's no longer a lie. Hehe.)”
Quite the cunning ploy.
“Liar～!”
Kanon suddenly started shouting.
“Huh?”
“Pardon, Azai-san?”
Kanon's pretty famous at school. Everyone knows her, including the teachers.
...But let's save that story for later. At the moment, Eiichi's face is beginning to convulse.
“Non-chan knows Ei-chan doesn't know how to swim.”
“Wha-what did you just say?”
“(Dammit! Why the hell did she have to say that...!?)”
“Remember when we went on that beach trip? Well, the second Ei-chan got in the water, he started to drown.”
“(You backstabbing, gossiping harlot! Even though you knew I couldn't swim, you rammed me right into the sea laughing all the while!)”
“E-Eiichi-kun? What are you mumbling about?”
“N-n-nothing, nothing at all.”
“Oh, but Ei-chan, it's so obvious that you have something to say〜.”
Kanon displayed a teasing smile.
“Ah, hahaha, you're embarrassing me. Don't worry, I signed up for swimming classes after that trip.”
“Really? Really? Which pool did you go to?”
Well, he's lying, so there's no way he'd be able to answer...
I wonder how Eiichi is going to escape this dilemma.
“I, I'm on day duty today, so I have to go. See you girls later!”
C'mon now. Running isn't going to fix the problem.
“Ei-chan, you're not really on day duty, are you!?　Wait up!”
And so the demon chased the clown.
Ahhh... despite the bitter cold, school is still peaceful.
Eiichi arrived at the classroom with Kanon right on his tail.
“Ha, ah, ha...”
Perhaps it's because he sprinted the entire way, but Eiichi can't even stand up straight anymore.
“Nii-san, Nii-san.”
On the other hand, Kanon didn't even break a sweat.
“Non-chan's going to go to sleep until class starts.”
“Oh? Are you tired because of the morning practice?”
“No, I was talking to Paparin last night. We stayed up pretty late.”
With Gonzou...?
“Did Papa say anything?”
“‘Good luck, and try to get into the Olympics.’ Isn't that sweet?”
“...Yeah.”
My worries seem to be piling up into quite the mountain, but I won't think about it much at school.
“Hey, I just noticed it, but what's in the bag?”
Kanon was carrying a duffel bag in addition to her backpack.
“It's just my gym uniform.”
Oh, right. We have PE today.
“Isn't that a designer brand?”
“Weren't you the one who bought this for me?”
“Oh yeah, I was.”
“Well then, Non-chan is going to sleep now～.”
She passed out as soon as she got to her seat. It was almost like something out of a comedy manga.
“...Hey, Kyousuke.”
Eiichi called out to me the moment Kanon was down.
“You understand my feelings, right Bro?”
“Say what now?”
with that bitch Kanon. I've been patient with her up until now since she's your sister. Ain't I forgiving?”
“L-listen, man...”
“But even I have my limits! If she keeps interrupting my hunting, I'm gonna have to teach her a lesson.”
“No, I'd say the problem here is the methods you employ in your hunting...”
“Shut up! We have club activities today.”
“Huh? Club activities? I'm afraid the only club I belong to is the ‘going-home club.’”
“What's this bull you're spouting now? The two of us started a secret society, remember? You promised you'd conquer the universe with me!”
...Hmm, I have the feeling I did do something like that.
“Don't tell me you forgot.”
“Don't worry, I remember. The lab equipment storage room, right?”
Upon hearing that, Eiichi's mouth curved into a mischievous smile.
“Right. I'll see you after school...”
Eiichi walked out of the classroom.
I looked around at my fellow classmates.
It seems Shiratori is absent today.
Homeroom is about to begin.
“Haah, I made it...”
“How rare. You were almost late.”
Tsubaki smiled shyly upon hearing my greeting.
“I pulled an all-nighter and ended up sleeping in this morning.”
“You were writing in your diary all night, weren't you?”
“Huh, how did you know?”
“It was an easy guess.”
“It's because I was with you yesterday, and the things that I felt I had to write just kept on pouring out.”
“Are we going to be hanging out again today?”
“Ah, you remembered!”
“Of course. But the thing is, something just came up, and Eiichi and I are gonna have to take care of some business on campus. So would you mind meeting up somewhere instead of waiting for me?”
“Sure. We'll meet up at the same cafe as yesterday.”
“If anything happens, just call me. You still have my cell number, right?”
“Yep, no problem.”
Tsubaki flashed me a brilliant smile.
“Oh, looks like Shiratori is absent again today...”
“Yeah, did you hear anything about it?”
Tsubaki shook her head apologetically.
“Usami isn't here either.”
“Usami Haru, huh...? She transferred here only yesterday...”
“I should get her phone number. She said we could be friends starting today.”
“...Don't you think it's kinda weird to say something like, ‘Let's be friends starting tomorrow?’”
“Not at all. Usami's just shy, I'm sure of it.”
“I've been thinking this for a while now, but your kindness is really intimidating, you know that?”
“Come again?”
“Nothing. Class is about to start.”
We returned to our seats.
And so, even though lunch break arrived, Usami was still nowhere to be found.
“Ah, Miki-chan, I really want to thank you for the other day.”
I was on the phone.
“Ei-chan, lying is bad, you know.”
“I wasn't lying. Can't you give me a break?”
Eiichi looked like he was going to cry while he stuffed his face with pudding.
“Your personality's all twisted 'cause you eat sweets all the time!”
“It's okay as long as I eat different sweets every day!”
“That's ridiculous.”
“I don't care! It's my policy, anyway! Chocolate yesterday and pudding today!”
Well, come to think of it, he does actually eat something different every day.
“The weather's nice today, and everyone's getting along. It's really fun, period.”
Everyone's passing the time in their own way, as usual.
“Hey, let's all go to the heated pool this Sunday.”
“I, I have to go and buy pet food, so I can't go.”
huh, is that...?”
Tsubaki's eyes widened.
“Isn't that... Usami-san?”
“Ah, it is.”
As if seeing a lighthouse in a storm, Eiichi sprinted over.
“There's no way anybody could mistake that hair.”
“Hey～, Usamin!”
Kanon gave her a nickname, just like that.
“......”
It seems like Usami finally noticed us.
I had just finished my phone call.
Pretending to be a playboy is hard work.
“Usamin, come over here!”
Everyone was waving at her.
“......”
Usami cautiously approached us.
Her monstrous head of hair billowed, completely ignorant to the laws of physics.
“Ah, hi...”
“Usamin, when did you get here?”
“Just now. I tend to sleep in every single day.”
“Why did you come to the roof?”
“Huh?”
“...‘Huh?’ isn't exactly the answer I was looking for... didn't we see you here yesterday, too?”
“No, there's no special reason... I just like high places, that's all.”
Tsubaki walked straight toward her.
“Usami-san, Usami-san.”
“...Huh?”
“We're going to be friends from today onward, right?”
Tsubaki looked extremely happy.
“Who are you?”
“Ahwu!”
Critical hit.
“Ah, I apologize. I remember now.”
“You do?”
“Yes.”
She stuck her chin up in the air.
“My name is Usami Haru, and you are?”
“...Suddenly she seems really imposing...”
“Ts-Tsubaki.”
“Tsubaki, huh? That's good. I got it.”
“Ah, Non-chan too, I want to introduce myself! I'm Kanon!”
“Okay. Kanon. Got it.”
“Ah, me, me too! I'm Eiichi!”
“No. Two people a day is my limit.”
“Waitaminute!”
“Tsubaki, Kanon, listen well. Please call me ‘Hero’.”
“A what?”
“Wuh?”
“Any complaints?”
“It's not that I'm complaining...”
“Why～?”
“No particular reason, but I make my comrades call me by that name.”
“I still don't get it, but okay.”
“I'm fine with it too, if it means that we can be friends.”
“Hero, Hero.”
“Hero-san, Hero-san.”
Why is this scene so bizarre...?
“......”
She seems like she's really enjoying this...
“Alright, I'm in a great mood right now. So, I'll give you jobs.”
Jobs?
“Tsubaki, you're a cleric.”
“Eh? A cleric? What do they do?”
“They're healers.”
“Healers?”
“That really suits Bakii! Hey, hey, what about Non-chan?”
“You're a warrior.”
“Ohhh, a warrior! That sounds really strong!”
“W-what about me!? I want to be a mage!”
“Etekichi-san can just be a slime.”
“At least let me be in your party!”
“I don't know how to explain it, but whenever I see Etekichi, I think about sticky things.”
“（B-bitch...!）”
“Hey, hey, what about my brother?”
“Me?”
“Oh, uh... Usami-san, this is Azai-kun.”
Tsubaki went to the trouble of introducing me.
“I see...”
She checked me out from head to toe.
“W-what...?”
“...Ooh?”
As if she'd just discovered something shocking, Usami's face suddenly tensed up.
“...Surely...”
“What?”
“......”
I can't read her face.
It's a strange expression, or rather, she's expressionless. It's as if she's thinking about something and having no thoughts at all at the same time.
“Hey, what kind of character is my brother? He's just a jester, isn't he?”
“No...”
As Usami parted her lips, the bell that signaled the end of lunch rang.
“Haha! I have no idea what's going on, but it's nice to meet you.”
I extended my hand, hoping for a mutual response.
“......”
“What's wrong? Did we meet in a previous life?”
“May I ask you something?”
Usami put on a strange expression.
“You're not an ordinary student, are you?”
“Are you a fortune teller? I'm just an average, run-of-the-mill student that can be found anywhere.”
She's a strange one...
“What kind of ‘ordinary student’ in this age would do something as embarrassing as shake hands with someone they just met?”
...Now that she mentions it, I suppose that's true.
“What kind of girl in this age would have others call her a hero for no reason?”
...The habits from my job subconsciously surfaced.
“I guess you have a point.”
The corner of her lips tugged into a grin.
...What about this is amusing, exactly?
“We should hurry back. We've got PE.”
“Ah, right. We'd better hurry!”
“Kanon-chan really likes sports, huh?”
“We're playing volleyball today!”
“Usami-san, let's go.”
Kanon pranced off with her usual excess of energy.
“Aren't you coming, Usami?”
“......”
She silently stared at me.
...I'd better ignore her.
“See ya down there, then...”
I left the roof in a hurry.
I don't know why, but I could feel her lingering gaze on my back all the way back to the classroom.
Break time.
I was called to the faculty office.
While I'm at school, I try to avoid attracting attention or provoking the judgment of my peers. Of course, that involves a bit of effort outside everyone's line of sight.
But, due to my frequent skipping, I'm occasionally called out by the teacher.
I didn't bother putting effort into the pop quiz yesterday, so now my math teacher's out for blood. He's got that ‘passion for education’ thing going on.
“You know, Azai, I've always thought that you'd do much better if you only tried harder.”
“No, I tried pretty hard.”
“This is yesterday's quiz. You answered these wrong on purpose, didn't you?”
“Of course not～.”
“Whatever. Just try to answer these questions.”
There was a worksheet laying on the teacher's messy desk.
He tapped his finger over the logistic curve on the paper.
“What? Right now?”
“Hurry up. Think of this as review.”
...Looks like neglecting the quiz was a bad call.
“Alright... I'll do it...”
I held the pencil and gazed at the questions.
“Umm... this here goes like this...”
“This is really easy for you, isn't it?”
The teacher was staring at me like a hawk, observing my every move.
“Don't stare at me like... ah!”
“What?”
The lead snapped.
“Well, just look. The desk is a little bumpy, don't you think?”
If one were to look closely, one would notice the many small holes on the desk, along with countless scratches.
“Well, it is a teacher's desk, after all. It's served me well these long years.”
“...Oh, c'mon, it's just a desk. Trying to write on this thing messes up the characters... and look right here, it even made me tear a hole in the paper.”
“Stop gabbing. Hurry up and do your work...”
“Ah... break time's over...”
Even then, the math teacher wouldn't let me go.
Then again, it wasn't all that bad.
Compared to my job, school's heaven.
...
......
After school was over, I crept over to the lab equipment storage room.
It's usually locked.
But a teacher let me borrow the key once, and I secretly made a duplicate.
This is Eiichi's and my territory.
Let the secret club activities begin.
Eiichi was in the hall, waiting for permission to enter the room.
“Bees.”
“Flying, honey-making insects.”
“Babies.”
“Prodigal progeny, fruits of my loins.”
“Rabies.”
“Very scary.”
“Wannabes.”
“Yeah!!”
And thus, the password check was complete.
“Very well, you may enter.”
“It's been a long time, God.”
“Yes, it's been half a year.”
“Nah, we met last month. Kinda a forgetful deity, ain'tcha?”
“How rude. My time is infinite, and therefore my concept of time isn't as specific as yours.”
“Ah, I apologize, God.”
Eiichi knelt in front of me.
“But seriously, Lord, that headpiece is tasteless as crap.”
“Silence, mortal. You're the one that made me wear this in the first place.”
“Wait, really?”
“If you feign ignorance, God will become wrathful.”
“I sincerely apologize. Every time I've come to thee, you've given aid, and I'll never forget my debt to you.”
“Yes. The fact that you can enjoy this existence is all thanks to me.”
“Right. You were the one who gave me Miss Noriko's phone number, God.”
“Yes.”
“You were also the one who told me Miss Noriko liked to drink.”
“I'm glad you understand.”
“But why on Earth can't I seal the deal with her?”
“That's your problem.”
“Whatever. I'm gonna cut to the chase. I have a new request.”
“Sure, let's hear it. There's nothing I can't do.”
Eiichi lowered his head.
“Someone's cramping my style.”
“Mmm... how tragic. It is simply human nature that one cannot avoid hating another.”
“That freaking girl... she, she stomped all over my love with her dirty feet!”
“Oh... that's truly unforgivable.”
“Yes, God. Please visit your judgment upon her and bring down the mighty hammer of retribution!”
“No problem. What's her name?”
“Kanon.”
“Who?”
“Azai Kanon.”
“Hey, wait a minute.”
“What's wrong, God? You've always been there to give me a dirty trick when I needed one.”
“Yeah, but this is completely different...”
“You taught me how to peek into the girl's bathroom without getting caught, how to eat in the classroom without getting caught, how to sneak into the faculty office without getting caught...”
“Hold it right there.”
“No, I've just about had it. If it wasn't for her, Noriko would have been mine a long time ago.”
“Oh, come on, you're projecting here. Besides, Kanon is my...”
“God is God, isn't he? The one and only! God can't have a sister!”
Looks like he's going to get his revenge one way or the other.
“Cool down. Kanon may be a spoiled brat, but she's not a bad person.”
“Ehh?”
“Don't ‘Ehh?’ me.”
“Ahh.”
“Don't ‘Ahh’ me, either. What are you, an infant?”
“Damn... there's no point in acting cute in front of you.”
“I already know what you're really like.”
“So you really won't help me out? No matter what?”
“No.”
“Grrrr...　fine then, you bastard!”
“Alright, meeting adjourned. God has better things to do.”
After putting the cone hat on the rack in my makeshift dressing room, I walked out into the hall.
“I can't believe you're so heartless.”
“Revenge isn't a good thing.”
Eiichi looked like he wanted to spit on the floor.
“If it's a girl you want, I can always introduce you to another one.”
“No! Unless she's older than me, graduated from post-secondary, and makes more than ten mil a year, I don't want her.”
“Oh, please. That's utterly impossible.”
...No, it wouldn't be [ font italic="true" ]that[ resetfont ] impossible.
The only problem would be that I'd have to use my other, non-student persona to introduce him to such a woman.
“This is boring. Let's go to the arcade.”
“Ah, about that...”
“What? You're not honestly going to pretend you're busy when I know you're just heading to Central Boulevard to pick up girls all night, are you?”
“Not this time. I promised I'd meet up with Tsubaki.”
“Huh? Who cares? Just pretend you forgot like you always do.”
“We're going to buy CDs together. We were together yesterday, too, you know. This could be the start of a brand new love.”
“Oh, for... that's precisely the problem with you daydreaming horndogs.”
“C'mon, a promise is a promise.”
“Sheesh. You bullshit all day long, but then you turn around and act like some main character with an unbreakable moral code. I really want to beat you up sometimes.”
That's actually rather satisfying.
“Haha... see you tomorrow.”
It seems that the school's opinion of me meets my expectations.
“I'm going to go home to find comfort in my bunny.”
If I maintain this lie, others will begin to see it as the truth...
When I came upon Central Boulevard, the streets were already illuminated by the endless rows of neon lights.
It would appear that I'm a bit late.
Pushing back the suffocating crowd, I walked toward the cafe ‘Lapis Lazuli’.
“Welcome! Table for one?”
The waiter greeted me with a single finger raised.
“No, someone's waiting for me...”
As I glanced around the cafe, I realized that I couldn't find Tsubaki.
“Excuse me, did a girl wearing the Jiyuuga Saki uniform stop by?”
The waiter tilted his head a bit.
“...She carries a diary around everywhere...”
“Ah, yes, I remember. Indeed, she was here.”
“Did she already leave?”
“I saw a man with her. They left together just a short while ago.”
...What...? Don't tell me...
“...What was the man like?”
“He talked to every girl who'd lend him an ear. Wore a black jacket, very big and very tall.”
...Yep, a con artist.
He probably saw Tsubaki as an easy target.
Generally, con artists won't immediately bring their prey into their office.
Instead, they'll talk with girls in some place with a nice atmosphere, like this cafe, trying to measure them up.
“Jesus, that naive girl...”
...At the best, he wants her to work at his hostess bar. At worst, he'll want her in a porno.
Even though I had just arrived, I immediately left.
There are four operational ‘talent agencies’ of varying sizes along Central Boulevard.
All of them are under the protection of Azai Gonzou's organization.
Of course, they all know what the Azai Corporation is.
Even though I didn't want to resort to this, I really have no choice...
I dialed on my cell.
“This is a call from the Azai Corporation. Has your agency been in contact with a girl named Tsubaki in the past few hours? She'd be wearing a Jiyuuga Saki uniform...”
......
...
An hour passed.
“Ah, Azai-kun!”
Tsubaki walked down the dark stairs of the building.
“Ah, I finally found you! It's nearly impossible when you don't carry a cell.”
Despite being picked up by a con artist, she doesn't seem to be in any bad shape.
“...What happened?”
I pretended to not know anything.
“Well, this magazine photographer said he wanted me to take some photos with him.”
“Wow... not bad. You are pretty cute.”
“Not really, but thank you.”
That smile almost ended up in a dirty magazine.
“But you promised you'd meet me at the coffee shop. You shouldn't just go off with strangers.”
“I'm sorry. Really, really sorry. He was just so passionate, it would've been so sad if I rejected him... and I did want to try and contact you first.”
“But there aren't any phone booths on Central Boulevard, so he said that I could use the phone at his workplace...”
Seriously? This girl has absolutely no sense of danger or suspicion...
“So, what about the photographs?”
“Well, they didn't even take a single one. I don't know why, but he suddenly said that I should go home, and respectfully escorted me to the door.”
Of course that bastard would be respectful after hearing the Azai family name.
“I probably just wasn't good enough.”
At that, I could only crack a wry smile.
“Eh, forget about it. It's no big deal. Let's go get that Bach CD.”
“Oh, yeah. Sorry for making you wait.”
...
......
After we bought everything, we casually strolled along the streets.
“Azai-kun, why did you buy two of the same CD?”
“Hehehe, you don't know?”
“Uhm... I'm sorry, I really don't.”
I explained as I looked at the two CDs.
“The first is for my collection. I'm never going to open it. Room decoration only.”
“Wow, you must really like it. The only songs Bach wrote that I know are ‘Air on the G String’ and ‘Toccata and Fugue’.”
“Well, those are some of his most famous pieces. This CD is centered around ‘Chaconne’.”
“‘Chaconne’?”
“To be specific, it's the ‘Partita No.2 in d-minor’. It's played exclusively by violins, so it's very hard to put together.”
“Eh, partita?”
“There are many versions of this ‘Chaconne’. The most famous is probably the one by Busoni, but personally, I'm not too hot on that one.”
“Busoni?”
“Although, while Bach's polyphonic compositions are excellent of course, I do think that some of his works that hold back a bit or rein in their complexity and difficulty, pieces much like ‘Air’ and ‘Fugue’ that allow the audience to enjoy the beauty of their melodies, have a charm of their own.”
“Oh, uh... yeah I get you...”
“The ‘French Suites’ are an astounding example of this. If we wanted to talk performers, Leonhardt plays the best harpsichord on those pieces, but you'd have to give me a little more time to think when it comes to the piano.”
“Wow... really?”
“Even though I've said this much, please don't think of me as a die-hard fan. I still don't really understand the appeal of his Church Cantatas, for example.”
“（How is this not acting like a die-hard fan...?）”
......
...
“Thanks for being with me today. I even got a cute diary. I had a lot of fun.”
“In the end, what sets Bach apart from the rest is...”
“（H-he's still not done!?）”
We arrived at the station before we knew it.
“Oh, crap. I promised Kanon that I'd come watch her this evening.”
Skipping out twice in a row would drive her nuts.
“Really? I'm sorry for keeping you for so long.”
“Nah, don't worry about it... just a second, I need to take this...”
“Oh, go ahead. Is it Kanon-chan?”
I grabbed my phone.
“Hey... oh, Miki-chan, what's up?”
“......”
“Oh...? Yeah, right... really...? Well, let's grab some dinner next time, okay?”
“......”
“Yes, yes. See ya.”
It was nothing important.
“Sorry, Tsubaki, I have to go now.”
“A-Azai-kun, Azai-kun!”
Tsubaki was forcing her lips shut, swallowing her tension.
“What?”
“...Well...”
“Yeah?”
“Can you lend me that CD?”
“Sure, no problem. I'll give it to you a couple days from now after I've finished listening to it.”
...Was that really it?
“Great... then I'll see you at school tomorrow.”
...It seems that she's still hiding something. Oh well, who cares?
After saying goodbye, I left for the skating rink.
It was two stations from Central Boulevard by train.
The skating arena is right smack in the middle of the Central District, and is a complex building indeed. Inside are not only regular ice rinks, but also specialized ones for ice hockey and figure skating. Not to mention the fact that they keep it open year-round.
With the amount of media attention Kanon has been receiving recently, it's not surprising that Tomanbetsu City is going all-out with its sports facilities.
It was six-thirty already.
It's almost time to clear out the regular customers and make the complex into a facility solely dedicated to reserved practice time.
I got in after explaining to security that I was a relative of Kanon.
Of course, joining these athletes on the ice during their rigorous training is strictly forbidden.
I sat in the stands and silently observed the practice.
“Hey, Nii-san!”
A happy, carefree voice came from the direction of the rink.
I couldn't see her coach anywhere, so it was probably break time.
“Nii-san, look, look!”
Kanon gracefully glided around a track, not even wearing a coat.
“Hey, what are you playing?”
“It's not a game, it's compulsory figures!”
Compulsory figures is an event where an athlete has to etch a pattern onto the ice.
Although, since it was unsuitable for TV broadcast, the event has been excluded from most competitions.
“Practice is going to be over soon, so wait for me!”
Kanon was on one leg, going in a circle. Occasionally she would change the direction of the curve, slowly tracing out a symbol on the ice.
Due to its slow nature, it doesn't look all that fancy. I'm getting bored here, but for Kanon, it's an important test of her skills.
“All done!”
“To keep on practicing, even during break... Impressive.”
“Hehe, wait till you get a load of this!”
Kanon faced me while skating backwards.
The skates traced out two parallel curves with complete ease.
“Wow. Have you gotten better or something?”
I gave her an obligatory compliment.
“I'm going to go spiiiiiiiiiin now!”
Pivoting off that motion, she began to spin.
But it would appear that she didn't generate enough momentum, and she suddenly stopped shortly thereafter.
“Wow. That looked really good or something.”
“Nii-san, if you're always halfhearted like that, Non-chan's going to get angry, you know～?”
“Well, I'm not a judge or anything, so I really don't know.”
“Still, it seems like you've lost some weight.”
“Yup. Thanks to that, I can jump even higher now!”
Height: 5'3", body shape: well-proportioned.
However, it was her long limbs that really gave her the edge in figure skating.
“Whoaaaaaah!”
When she tried executing a second jump, she lost her balance.
“Hey now, don't get too cocky and injure yourself.”
“If I got hurt, you'd come take care of me, right?”
She chatted as she came over to the seats.
“Aren't you cold?”
“No, I'm perfectly fine.”
“That thing you're wearing... is that your competition costume?”
“Yup.”
“Is it okay to be wearing that right now?”
“The big day's coming up, so I have to wear this while practicing.”
In a month and a half, Kanon will be entering a competition that is used to select Olympic participants.
“But, the main reason I'm wearing it today is because I wanted you to see it!”
She held out her arms and hugged me tightly.
“Hey, watch it!”
“Whaaaat?”
“Look at your feet! Those razor sharp blades almost cut my toes off!”
“Hehe! Slice 'em and dice 'em!”
This girl has a weird sense of humor...
“Oh yeah, where's Mama?”
“Coach? She's in a meeting right now.”
“She's really busy, huh? I wanted to say hi, at least.”
“Well, it's 'cause, Non-chan just went to Canada, right? Since my foreign training is done, now they're talking about the direction they want to take with me.”
“What direction do you want to go in?”
“I don't know. But, I'm definitely going to the Olympics!”
She's a simple one, isn't she?
“Hey, hey, listen to my popularity plan!”
“Plan?”
“The plan is to be even more famous so that more people will come and watch Non-chan's performances!”
“Great! What comes next?”
“Um, that's it.”
“It's a vague plan, but that's so like you. I'm sure you'll be fine.”
Kanon returned to the skating rink once again, smiling all the while.
“Now then, I'm gonna show you my quad jump too!”
“Oh, you mean the loop?”
‘Quad jump’ refers to the quadruple lutz, an extremely difficult jump that has never been successfully performed in any public women's competition around the world.
The jumping itself is easy. Landing the damn thing is the hard part.
“I've always fallen down before, but I'm sure I can do it if you're watching, Nii-san.”
“Hey, don't try it if you can't do it. It hurts when you fall, doesn't it?”
“But I'm going to be even more popular if I pull it off!”
“That only works if you succeed.”
“Everyone loves it when you bring out new techniques, so I have to try my hardest to make it work!”
Kanon started skating again, full of momentum.
...Hm?
“Nii-san, I'm starting now!!”
“Wait, I'm getting a call...”
It's probably Miki-chan again... geez, there's a limit on how much you can disrupt my life, you know...
“Hello...?”
However, when I heard the voice coming through the receiver, I couldn't help but hold my breath.
“Nii-san, are you finished yet～?”
Kanon was nowhere near my radar.
“I'm starting! I'm jumping! You'll be sorry if you miss it!”
After the call disconnected, I said one thing to her.
“Sorry, something came up.”
“What? Wait, wait!”
Kanon stomped her feet, and the sound of crushed ice reached my ears.
My mindset had already changed.
My carefree time in the surface world was already over.
Because that call was from Azai Gonzou, summoning me to his quarters...
The city's Southern District is very quiet. It's a tranquil, high class residential district with newly built homes lined up one after the other.
Each of the many mansions is so spacious and luxurious that it creates the illusion that one isn't even in Japan anymore.
The pedestrian count is remarkably low, and I only occasionally pass by a cop patrolling on a bicycle.
The luxurious doors all bear the metal plates of various protection agencies, sparing not even the space for an insect to pass through.
It's an area that suitably demonstrates the power of the people who live here... and control this city.
After around an hour, I arrived at Gonzou's estate.
...No matter how often I come here, I still get nervous.
“......”
When I pressed the doorbell, a maid quickly answered.
“It's Kyousuke. Is my father in the house?”
......
...
After a few more minutes, I was allowed through the gate.
Two expensive black cars were parked on the grounds.
I looked at the pond as I walked through the hall.
On the way, I met a few of Gonzou's subordinates, and greeted them.
Gonzou is having dinner with a guest right now.
I was commanded to join them for a drink.
...I can only follow instructions.
I finally arrived at the door of the guest room.
Light leaked out from beyond the sliding door.
I didn't hear a conversation.
Instead, I only heard the sound of alcohol rapidly flowing through someone's throat.
Without a doubt, that man awaited me on the other side.
“Pardon the interruption, Sir. It's Kyousuke.”
After a short while...
“Oh...”
Azai Gonzou released a deep sigh that resembled the braying of an animal.
“May I join you?”
I heard that there was a guest, but I couldn't sense anyone else in there.
“Enter.”
I immediately sensed something abnormal.
“You're here.”
A series of extravagant dishes had been strewn about the tatami mats.
“It's been a long time. I sincerely apologize.”
In this traditional room, a man who appeared to be a guest lay before me.
He was bleeding from the forehead, and was lying down flat on the table.
I gazed at the man, unsure whether he was dead or alive, and put on a mask of indifference.
“How have you been lately?”
“There are no problems worth mentioning.”
No problems at all.
Before my father... before Azai Gonzou, I'm used to the sight of blood.
On the corner of the table lay a crumpled business card.
Maiyuu Station. First Planning Department. Executive Producer.
I think I've heard his name before.
Every Monday at prime time, he airs popular drama shows with over 20% viewer rates. This guy is pretty famous.
Both his personal and work lives are riddled with impressive exploits, and there is no person in the entertainment world who wouldn't wag his or her tail for him.
“What's wrong? Does this bother you?”
“No.”
If he gave out his card, that means this is the first time they've met.
“This guy is far too arrogant for his own good.”
“You haven't changed, Father...”
Kanon is famous as a beautiful figure skater. She's even been in a few commercials.
If Gonzou called this man ‘arrogant’, then it's probably not his personality... it's likely because of some problem with a contract.
At any rate, my father just submerged someone into the sea of violence upon their first meeting. Someone of rather prominent stature, no less.
When I was younger, I always wondered why he could bend the rules like that.
“...Uh, ah...”
It seems like the man is still alive.
“...D-do you think you're j-just going to get away with doing something like this to me?”
“......”
Gonzou glanced at the man as he picked up a piece of sashimi unrivaled in taste.
“I'm going to tell my, my lawyer... no, screw that... the police... I'll wipe you away, you scumbag... I'll wipe you from the face of the earth...”
“......”
Gonzou laughed gleefully.
“Your daughter's about twenty, correct?”
Gonzou took another swallow of delicious sake.
“......”
I can understand what Gonzou is thinking.
It's too late now.
To those who have never experienced true danger, threatening to call their lawyers or the police at the first sign of hostility seems completely logical.
Only, it's too late.
The police won't move until something has happened, and a lawyer can't be by one's side 24/7.
“So... you think you'll be satisfied after your daughter finds herself shipped off to the highest bidder and some of our worthless thugs do time in jail for it?”
This isn't a dry threat.
Multitudes of delinquents under Azai Gonzou's control are just licking their lips, desperately waiting to receive any order.
Beasts who would take pride in their time spent in custody.
They're illogical creatures, men who don't even analyze the immediate future. They merely follow orders down to the letter.
“Well, sit down and have some sashimi.”
Blood is splashed here and there across the food.
“The blowfish looks particularly delicious. Thank you, Sir.”
The man's breath was as feeble as an insect's, yet I picked up my chopsticks.
“...C-call an ambulance...”
“Are you going to drink?”
“No, alcohol's a bit...”
“S-save... me...”
“It's Shouchuu liquor, made in Kyuushuu. It's quite something.”
“Really...?”
“Uh, wuuuuh...”
This guy is on his last leg.
Nevertheless, the two of us neglect him, and enjoy our food.
This is the relationship between Azai Gonzou and Azai Kyousuke.
“Well then, what's the day's command?”
I timidly cut to the chase. Gonzou tilted his head.
“You're carrying the smell of a woman.”
“Pardon?”
...What's he talking about?
“You got a bitch?”
“No...”
Paying no mind to my refusal, he glared at me, emitting an unspoken, suffocating pressure.
I swallowed.
“I was fooling around with a classmate, Miwa Tsubaki, for a couple of days. That was it, really. She has no money, so I have no real interest in her.”
“......”
Gonzou stared at me once again.
He's almost six and a half feet tall.
The giant excreted intimidation from his every pore.
“Is there something amiss?”
“Not that woman.”
“......”
A woman I've been around, but not Tsubaki?
“I met with Kanon.”
“Yes, she told me.”
Gonzou took a furious swig of the liquor.
“Kanon is different than Ikuko. She has spirit.”
Ikuko is Kanon's mother.
I call her ‘Mama’ when I'm at school or speaking with Kanon. She's a figure skating coach.
Also, she was Gonzou's lover long ago.
In other words, even though Kanon was his only daughter, she was still merely the child of a mistress.
Gonzou's real wife died a while ago. I never met her.
Kanon doesn't know about this, and obviously Gonzou and Ikuko live separately.
“Kanon's personality is much more similar to yours than her mother's.”
Stubborn and arbitrary...
“That girl will turn out to be quite profitable.”
“Yes...”
She's a candidate for the Olympics.
Publishers and production companies are constantly knocking at the door.
If she does manage to get in, foreign media will undoubtedly be interested in coverage.
“Her future is looking bright. As a front organization, we at the Azai Corporation should consider using her as a powerful PR tool to help improve our image.”
Gonzou gave a satisfied nod at my suggestion.
“About Kanon...”
Gonzou opened up his hairy fist.
The atmosphere in the room suddenly became unpleasant.
“Listen, Kyousuke.”
When he called my name, my anxiety peaked.
“Fuck her.”
“......”
In an instant, the strong man in front of me turned into a detestable monster.
“If you want a bitch to do what you want, you have to eat her up.”
How can such a father even exist?
Even if she's illegitimate, Kanon is still his flesh and blood.
To have his foster son engage in such intimacies, one must question the man's sanity.
“We have to milk as much money as possible from her. Men may be all about logic and self-interest, but women are different... you got that?”
I gave an ambiguous nod.
“I don't care how you do it. You can pretend to love her, or even make her your rightful wife, for all I care. The most important thing is to establish a sexual relationship. Women place too much importance on that kind of thing. It's the easiest way to make those creatures obey you.”
“I, I understand... I'll see to it, sooner or later...”
My head is numb.
When I am before this monster, all regular thoughts cease.
“Also...”
Gonzou lowered his voice a notch.
“Have you heard of a small organization named ‘The Boys’?”
“Yes, they're an event circle which has gained a bit of power on Central Boulevard.”
An event circle is an organization that helps gather customers for clubs when special events are held.
They're just a group of party-loving thugs, but their outward appearance is pleasing, and they can dance and DJ. Compared to some talentless performers, they're actually quite good at gathering customers.
“Do you intend on doing business with them?”
After these organizations expand to a certain point, yakuza usually come in to help clean up the mess.
In exchange for a ‘protection fee’, the yakuza will then help them out when they run into any sort of trouble.
However, Gonzou wrinkled his brow at my supposition.
“They're selling cocaine.”
“...No way.”
My back erupted into a cold sweat.
Such a small organization actually dared to sell cocaine?
Unforgivable.
Of course, the reason that's unforgivable isn't because it's against the law.
All the cocaine circulating in this city is under the control of the Sonoyama Group. Azai Gonzou happens to be the leader of said group, the fourth in its history.
I only know what I have to, so I have no idea where they get the cocaine from.
But the important thing is that those amateurs went ahead and stepped in our territory.
“And it seems that their cocaine is of a higher quality than ours.”
“...That's very strange.”
“As we speak, I have men out looking for their leader.”
With his mobility, power, and extensive network of information, tracking down a little brat or two would take little to no effort.
“Ah, I understand. I might not be needed in this case, but I'll search amongst the shadows.”
I lowered my head deeply.
“Do so, Son.”
“Yes. After all, I owe my current lifestyle to you, Father.”
I drank with Gonzou until late into the night.
I have no idea what happened to that unfortunate producer.
...
......
My parched throat ached.
The smell of sweat assaulted me.
My back felt the soft caress of my bed.
...And my eyes opened to a familiar ceiling.
I knock into something as I reach out my hand for water.
“Oww...!”
The texture of Kanon's hair greeted my hand as it fumbled around.
“Ah, Nii-san, you're awake?”
Kanon had been sleeping seated on the floor, laying her head and arms on the bed beside me.
I suddenly understood the situation.
“I'm so sorry!”
I leaped out of bed and checked the time.
“You have to be at the short program today, right!?”
Even so, Kanon only made a lazy, absentminded sound.
“Mm, I'll be on my way.”
“Are you going to be late?”
“Well, later than they want me there, but it'll work out.”
“‘It'll work out...?’ But it's the Grand Prix Finals. Tons of really important people will be there, won't they?”
“Non-chan's popular, so they'll forgive her.”
I'm sure they'd have their hands full trying to lecture someone that arrogant anyway.
She had gone out and bought me a water bottle and some aspirin.
Warmth from a hot-water bag, which I know I didn't have here yesterday, seeps into my feet.
The cold, wet towel on my forehead tells me that Kanon took care of me through the whole night.
“Alright, I'll drive you there.”
“Ah, don't worry about it. You're still feverish, aren't you?”
“I'm fine, just get ready.”
“I'll just take a taxi.”
“I said I'm fine!”
“Even if you are, what about the usual complaints? If you take me to the arena, there'll be rumors...”
“Shut your mouth and hurry it up!”
“Alright, I get it. Thanks.”
In truth, though, I should be the one to thank her.
“This is far enough.”
I got out of the car and accompanied her the rest of the way.
“Alright! I'll get the gold today!”
Kanon raised her arm in a lively manner despite staying up all night.
“Kanon-chan!”
Ikuko-san was shouting to Kanon from the competitors entrance.
She rushed over to Kanon.
“Kanon-chan, what's wrong with you!? Mr. Hilton is furious! He wanted to introduce you to the representatives from the International Skating Union!”
“Yeah... I'll head over there right now.”
“What happened, Kanon-chan? What on earth happened!?”
“I'm very, very sorry, Ikuko-san. The truth is...”
Kanon interrupted me.
“Who cares? I just thought it'd be a pain to meet those bigshots. It's not my job to suck up to people outside the rink.”
Ikuko-san smiled wide.
“...K-Kanon-chan, I had no idea. I'm so sorry... why didn't you tell me you were that opposed to it?”
“It's fine, let's just go.”
“Hey, Kanon.”
“Non-chan isn't lying.”
Kanon answered gravely.
Indeed, it wasn't a lie.
But that wasn't the problem...
Kanon and Ikuko-san vanished into the arena before I had time to explain.
Shit... I just got Kanon into so much trouble.
I considered my options before being swallowed by waves of repentance.
At some point in the afternoon, I received word from Horibe while waiting for Tokita.
“I'm sorry, Son!”
That's not a good way to open a conversation...
“So, this morning...”
Horibe's report boiled my blood.
Saijou's babbling pushed his guards over the edge, and they beat him to death.
“What the fuck were they thinking...?”
We'd finally captured ‘Maou's’ accomplice.
But with this, we've lost our only lead.
Kanon... she'll be...
“I'm prepared to make this up to you as a man in the business.”
“Then take that ‘official apology’ bullshit and shove it up your ass where it belongs!!!”
I can't help but get angry as Kanon's face crosses my mind.
“...Sorry... look, let's just focus on what to do from here on out.”
“...To be quite honest, Son, I'm surprised. A little French and you're already thinking rationally again...”
“I'm sorry for lashing out at you. Anyway, I'll contact you again soon.”
I need to tell Usami and Tokita about the sudden shift in scenario.
Usami finally arrived at the rendezvous point.
“Yuki says she's not coming. She says she's sorry, and that she can't help us anymore.”
“It's alright... I feel bad for Tokita.”
“So, we're back to grasping at straws again, eh?”
“What we do know is that ‘Maou’ has his eyes set on Ikuko-san. I'll have men sent to protect her at the arena.”
“Hmm...”
Usami shook her head uncertainly.
“I know. The arena already has a sanctioned security force. If we try to take matters into our own hands, the two groups might just get in each other's ways.”
“We're walking on pins and needles, now.”
“...Alright. ‘Maou’ wants to see Kanon fail, right? If so, then he may use force.”
“You mean he might directly injure Kanon?”
“We can't eliminate the possibility, can we?”
“I suppose we can't. Still, there's something I want to try on my own.”
“Alright, do it. Contact me immediately if you find anything.”
Usami nodded lightly and vanished into the crowd.
I rushed to the arena.
Even though the sun still hadn't set, a profuse number of people had gathered in the seating area of the arena.
I used my position as Kanon's brother to make my way into a special staff-only passage.
I needed to call Ikuko-san out of her meeting.
Come to think of it, Ikuko-san isn't Kanon's official coach.
That would normally just make her a standard guest, but perhaps she's being allowed in as staff due to her role in supporting Kanon up until now.
Who knows? Maybe she even used some sort of connection with the tournament directors.
“What's the matter with you, Kyousuke-kun?”
“It's nothing to worry about. Are you busy at the moment?”
“Not particularly. Kanon-chan's in a bad mood right now, being a little snappish to everyone. It's unbecoming after coming in late to an international competition...”
“Hah... well, I'm sorry to hear that.”
First thing out of her mouth is a complaint...?
“So, uh... anything strange going on?”
“Anything strange?”
“Yeah... has anything around you seemed off somehow recently...? Well, besides the guys tailing you all the time.”
I didn't want to start a discussion about the yakuza escort arranged by Gonzou.
“Right... the people who seem to work for that man.”
‘That man’ means Gonzou.
“What's that all about, anyway? He abandoned this old girl years ago.”
A jeer leaked out.
“Ah, sorry. That's got nothing to do with you, Kyousuke-kun.”
Her face relaxed, but a harshness lingered for a moment in her eyes.
As if to plead, ‘You make sure to go give him an earful for me too, Kyousuke-kun.’
“What's going on?”
“I don't know... I'm not very clear on the matter...”
“Is it about Kanon-chan?”
One would usually jump to this conclusion.
“No, no, definitely not...”
If I make one little mistake with my word choice, she may advertise the problem to everyone around her.
“It's a little odd, though. That man would go to any lengths for Kanon-chan. If it was for me, he wouldn't lift a finger... at least, that's the way I see it.”
Kanon will be crushed if Ikuko-san is killed.
Anyone could tell this mother and her daughter aren't getting along well, but she's still her mother.
“Maybe the bodyguards have been called here for me.”
“Who knows...?”
This is bad. I probably should have just let sleeping dogs lie.
“Well, I'm sure it's nothing. I wouldn't worry about it.”
“Really? I sure hope nothing happens...”
A man approached us as we talked.
A man with a camera on his shoulder.
An armband bearing the message ‘Camera Allowed’ swung loosely from his jacket sleeve.
“Hello there! You're coach Kanesaki Ikuko, right?”
He's probably a reporter from a magazine.
The man bowed his head and shot Ikuko-san a flattering glance.
“Would you mind talking for a bit?”
“Sure, that'd be fine. Are you sure you want me?”
She put on a steady smile, as if changing into another person.
The man told her his name and the magazine he worked for.
It was hardly a publisher worth noting.
They're known for publishing racy books about celebrity scandals and yakuza.
“In fact, we were looking to invite you to write a book.”
“A book?”
“Last year's World Championships were a straight-up disaster, wouldn't you say?”
Ikuko-san gracefully shook her head.
“Even though there's only one seat at Worlds this year, I can say with confidence that each of the Japanese skaters last year did their very best.”
“Well, if Kanon had been there, things would've turned out differently.”
“Who knows?”
“You're the one who's been guiding her skating career, correct?”
The reporter smiled with glaring teeth.
Ikuko-san's attitude was resolute, but she couldn't hide the nervous smile pulling at the corners of her mouth.
...I had better leave this place.
I just can't bring myself to like this woman.
...
......
Time flows on, and the arena is still.
A number of skilled foreign skaters came out on the ice and were bathed in applause.
Eight P.M. rolled around.
The last group of competitors took to the ice for a warm-up.
The arena thundered loudly with applause as they skated into the rink.
It seemed the audience went crazy every time Kanon stuck a dynamic jump.
I was on edge.
‘Maou's’ trap aside, I was worried about Kanon's health.
She hardly slept for taking care of me.
Can she perform up to snuff when not at the top of her game?
As I pondered this, I took a call from Usami.
“How's everything on your end?”
“Seems good enough. If I didn't know better, I'd say everything's going smoothly.”
“Hmm... that's odd... if anything's going to happen, then it should be today...”
“Where are you, by the way?”
“Back at Saijou's hotel room, looking through his luggage. I found a passport and some plane tickets. He was probably going to flee the country on the red eye.”
“I see. That confirms he had something planned for today.”
“If ‘Maou’ really needed Saijou to enact his plan, then it's possible he's hesitating right now.”
“Saijou had the arena ticket, right?”
“Yeah, it's in here with the rest of his stuff. It's for today's short program.”
...Sure enough, something's going down here today.
“Azai-san, I... I think this case is...”
The call ended before she was able to finish her sentence.
My cell phone lost its signal.
I'd have stepped outside to call her back, but all the entrances were congested by the monstrous crowd.
“Nothing I can do, I guess...”
Time simply passed by, and the growing sense of impatience within me seemed too crushing to endure.
The situation turned out for the best, contrary to my earlier expectations.
Nothing had come to pass.
If I had to report something, it'd be that Kanon dished out another fantastic score.
I almost collapsed from relief upon seeing Kanon standing safely at the arena's entrance. You'd have thought that my fever came back with a vengeance or something.
No harm had come to Ikuko-san either.
There was no problem at all.
...
......
“I'm back～!”
I drove Kanon back to my apartment.
“Nii-san, I said, ‘I'm back.’ Where's my ‘Welcome home?’”
“We came back together, if you haven't noticed.”
Kanon looks silly now compared to her bewitching aura on the ice.
“I'm so glad you're feeling better now.”
“Thanks to you.”
“...But don't use that as an excuse to get all cocky on me, you hear?”
of it. But you know, you should thank Non-chan for saving your life.”
My fever wasn't [ font italic="true" ]that[ resetfont ] bad.
“How much?”
I gave Kanon that glare she thought would kill her all those years ago.
“Ahahaha, a gajillion yen.”
“No, seriously. How much did you shell out for the aspirin and the hot-water bag...? Just give me the receipt, we'll be squared-away in no time.”
“Eh, I tossed it.”
“What!? You idiot!”
“You're so funny.”
“Listen, you need to start holding onto your receipts. Besides being good practice, it'd probably make you realize just how much money you've been wasting.”
“Hoh?”
I took out ten thousand yen from my wallet as I clicked my tongue.
“Here.”
“Wait... you, of all people, just forking over ten thousand yen? Do you have a fever?”
“I did last night. Take it.”
“You probably won't be able to sleep until I do. Geez, you're gloomy, you know that?”
She pulled the money out from between my fingers, grumbling all the while.
“I'm sorry... I really am.”
“For what?”
“Well, I was just worried that your short program might suffer because of me.”
“Nah, I ended up doing pretty good. And you should know better than to worry about somethin' like that. Paparin always says, ‘Results are everything.’”
“Get to sleep early today.”
I reclined on my sofa and turned on the TV.
Upon switching to the sports news, I saw Kanon's smile behind a microphone.
“‘I'll try to keep this momentum going tomorrow.’”
The famous athlete on the screen used a totally different tone from my sister.
“Wooow, Non-chan's so mature...”
Kanon watched the interview with me, and commented on her television self.
Judging by the video alone, Kanon seems like a mature adult woman.
After Kanon, Seta Makiko came up to speak. Her petite, charming frame suited televised interviews nicely.
“‘My goal tomorrow is to catch up to Kanon-san. I'll try my best to meet everyone's hopes tomorrow!’”
She sounded like a voice actress in an anime.
She was a small girl, and seemed to be quite likable.
“Hey Kanon, what do you think about her saying that?”
Kanon's eyes widened.
“Seta-san made it to the Finals too?”
“You'd better not say that in front of other people.”
Though Kanon doesn't mean anything by it, people would think she's ridiculing the girl.
“No, I just completely forgot. Yeah, that's right, she's still in.”
“You don't even follow the other skaters, do you...?”
“Hoeeee, not bad, Seta-san. 62 points is pretty good for you.”
“I watched people cry when you got a 70.3.”
“Hey now, you'll make Non-chan feel like a bad girl, saying she made people cry like that.”
Why is she so laid-back...?
“Hmm...”
However, when the replay of her program started running, Kanon's eyes changed.
“......”
“......”
“...Too slow.”
“......”
“That was way too slow...”
She's glaring with hatred at another self.
Despite having such a high score, she's still not content.
“Why was my line of sight drooping...? Was I really that tired...?”
She kept her voice low.
“I... I'm so sorry... really, I swear.”
“I'll sleep well today, so it doesn't matter.”
“Alright...”
She's kind of scary...
I turned off the TV, pretending that I hadn't noticed.
“Hm... sure enough, Non-chan is right.”
“About what...?”
“Today, Coach told me... ah, not Mr. Hilton, the other one. She said that I should try to flatten the blade of my skate during a spin so that I can rotate faster.”
“Yeah, and...?”
“Well, just look at it. It doesn't fit the music. When the music is so smooth, I don't need to spin so fast.”
“I don't really understand what you're getting at. Did you mess up?”
“Mmm, it's subtle. It just didn't feel right. I recovered right away, though. Still, if I hadn't tried that, I would've had another point.”
“You'd better listen to what Mr. Hilton says. Ikuko-san isn't your coach.”
“Yeah, that's probably true. Still, Non-chan was right.”
There seems to be discord between Ikuko-san and Mr. Hilton.
“So, Nii-san...”
She looked at me seriously.
“What...?”
“Though I shouldn't think about things like this...”
“Is this the follow-up of yesterday?”
‘I wanna be your partner.’
“Mm, there's that too, but...”
Kanon spoke with a little bit of irritation and a little bit of sadness.
“Is Coach's life in danger?”
I don't know how to answer.
What does my face look like right now, I wonder?
At the very least, I doubt I look relaxed.
“Wh... Danger...?”
I turned the question back with a reluctant smile.
“Right... what, was it some joke?”
“I'm not really sure what you're getting at. What's wrong?”
“When the show was over and we were about to pack up, Coach told me something like that. She looked real serious.”
――That damn woman!
“It must have been some horrible gag.”
“Yeah, well, it shocked me alright.”
“I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.”
“Hmm, I just can't figure out why she'd say that, though. Maybe because Non-chan wasn't happy and was ignoring her, she needed Non-chan's attention.”
“Yeah, that's probably it.”
Why!?
She shouldn't disturb her daughter, even if it really were only a joke.
I knew she was self-centered, but to think she'd go that far...!
“Alright, let's take a bath. Today is special, so I'll wash your hair for you.”
However, Kanon's face was still full of suspicion.
“It would explain why Papa's men are always hanging around Coach, though, don't you think?”
“Huh? Is that what's got you thinking your mom's life is in danger?”
pretty scary after all, right? I saw him with a gun once.”
“But why would that mean Ikuko-san's in danger?”
“Well, you know... skating is popular. Sometimes crazy idiots send threat letters to our office.”
“So? Those are jobs for the police. Is Papa a policeman?”
“Hmm... I guess you're right. Yeah, that's gotta be right. So nothing's wrong, then.”
That was way too close for comfort...
A chill ran through me when she said ‘threat letter’.
“Don't think too much. Just prepare yourself for tomorrow, and everything will be fine.”
“Alright...”
Her face simply didn't seem willing to accept it.
“Right. At this point, I can't afford to think about anything else.”
I didn't fail to spot the deep sadness in her eyes.
“I shouldn't even joke about this, but you know, if Coach did die, I'd just have to ignore it... or something.”
Kanon's face suddenly took on a ghostly pallor.
It was a face of anger, a face of despair; a face that overwhelmed me entirely.
The girl before me is a girl who lives for skating.
Kanon always corners herself into that role, it seems.
And when she does, I become the prisoner of that unstable region of her heart.
‘...I wanna be your partner.’
“Kanon...”
“What, why the serious face?”
“Right back at you. Don't look at me like that.”
“‘Like that?’ Why not? Isn't this normal?”
Her voice lays the blame with me.
“Nobody ever tells me the truth. Non-chan only needs to skate, and everything'll be fine.”
“Everyone tells me, ‘Just go skate.’”
“Even you, Nii-san.”
I look at Kanon, shocked.
A doubt flows over my mind...
...Yet I speak without hesitation.
“So the truth is, you don't like skating...?”
Kanon's eyes are filled with hatred.
“It's not a matter of whether I like it or not. I have to.”
She stares at me without any movement whatsoever.
“This conversation's over.”
“Tomorrow's the free skate.”
“And I'll win.”
“That's all.”
She lays her words on me syllable-by-syllable, trying desperately to suppress her pain.
“Oh, and Nii-san... please don't talk about silly things like this ever again.”
She continued in a soft-hearted whisper.
the wrong one here, Nii-san, not Non-chan.”
Although her ‘Ride of the Valkyries’ may not have been playing, Kanon was no longer in my room, but upon the ice.
She's only my sister in name.
This moment has forced me to take a good, hard look at the girl I've ignored until now.
I felt that she was pitiful.
Me, of all people, feeling pity――
And the chronic headache which had plagued me for so long left, as if it had never even been there.
......
...
Morning had arrived before I knew it.
The frigid fresh air did nothing to abate the heat sparked by the crowd loitering about the school gate.
Journalists and reporters bared their fangs at each commuting student, trying desperately to milk the recent hostage crisis for all it's worth.
...Cut it out, already... how's a guy like me supposed to avoid attention with all this racket...?
“Well, to be honest, I was all like, ‘Come get a piece of this!’”
...Hm?
Some shrimp had grabbed a microphone, and a horde of cameras converged on him.
“Honestly, I think I could have settled things without the help of the police.”
...He's shooting his mouth off again...
“...Yo, Shiratori.”
I showed up early today, but Shiratori was already in the classroom.
She was watering the flowers at the windowsill again.
“How did you of all people escape the cameras?”
“...I arrived before the media.”
“Well, be careful. You were the hostage, and what with your father being bashed left and right, they're probably out to nail you too.”
“...Beg your pardon?”
“What?”
“Are you worried about me?”
“No, I'm just saying what anyone would say in this situation.”
...I suddenly remember the call yesterday.
“Today after school, right?”
“...Ah, yeah...”
Shiratori suddenly lost her composure.
“Why'd you hang up on me, anyway? I can't figure you out...”
“...We'll talk after school.”
“After school, huh? What exactly is happening after school, anyway?”
“......”
“You trying to call me out and fight with me behind the gym? Looking to thrash me good?”
“Pardon?”
She frowned angrily.
“I'm kidding. I'll be there. I'll make sure I don't forget like usual.”
“I hate jokes like that.”
“Why can't you just talk to me now, though?”
“That would obviously be inappropriate.”
“The only one this is ‘obvious’ to is you.”
“Look, you'll find out after school...”
Dragging out the subject seems to make her pretty antsy.
What could she possibly want to talk to me about?
“Anyway, we can meet up at nine o'clock.”
“That's too late!”
“I dunno, I'd say it's pretty solidly ‘after school’...”
“‘After school’ means, like...”
“You know...”
“Are you honestly about to tell me nine o'clock isn't ‘after school’?”
“I-I... I got nothing.”
“...What?”
Shiratori's raised her voice at me as her face went red.
“L-look, that's way too late!”
“Use your head for a second. Nine P.M. is utterly ridiculous.”
“Stop teasing me with such banter.”
“Alright, two P.M. then.”
“That's too early.”
“Oh, come on... you gotta live on the edge. Sneaking out a little early should spice things up a bit.”
“That's not on the edge, it's over it. That literally fails to fall under ‘after school’.”
“Delinquents use ‘afternoon’ and ‘after school’ interchangeably. Material equivalence.”
“I'm an honor student.”
I don't think one really identifies ONESELF as such...
“Let's stick to the end of classes... you know, like normal people.”
“What if I come down with a sudden illness and have to leave school early?”
“Why would you even consider that case?”
She frowns again.
“Are you trying to avoid me or something?”
“It's nothing like that.”
“If you don't want to hear me out, just say so.”
That sad, angry face of yours tells me that would be a bad idea.
Has this girl always been so expressive?
“I'll be there, don't worry.”
“Very well... you'd better come.”
She passed by me as if running away.
But she didn't actually go anywhere, as she just escaped me to loiter about in the corner of the classroom.
Our classmates trickle in, yet not one of them talked to Shiratori.
...I guess they must believe the fault for the incident lies with Shiratori's father rather than Hashimoto.
Well, I suppose she's used to this isolation by now.
“Yo, Kyousuke. Mornin'.”
“Done with your interview?”
“Course. I'm a celeb now, Bro.”
Getting a little carried away, aren't we?
“Anyway, get this...”
“Sure, what...?”
I held out my right hand.
“What's with the hand?”
“100 yen.”
“Lucky! What'd I do to deserve this?”
“Nothing. Why the hell would I give you 100 yen?”
“What? Then what the heck are you talking about?”
“I'll listen to you if you give me 100 yen.”
“What!?”
“These days you have to pay to get your word out, know what I mean?”
“This is the first I've bloody heard of it!”
“Try talking to a lawyer for an hour on your way home today. They cost a shitload more than 100 yen.”
“That's because it's their job!”
“How's that any different from me listening to you?”
“Where the fuck are you pulling this out of!? Explain from the beginning!”
“Tuition at Azai University costs a grand per lecture. That alright with you?”
“I'm so happy to have such a great friend!”
“Don't be too merry, now.”
“Whatever. I give the fuck up, Bro.”
“I'm just kidding, dude. Let's hear it, I'll listen.”
“It's not something you should listen to just to appease me. It's really funny in its own right.”
“Oh, never mind then.”
“Bite the hook, you son of a bitch!”
“Just sounds like a scam to me.”
“I realized something after I got home yesterday.”
So he started talking after all...

“Hey, are you listening?”
“Totally.” “You're not planning on pulling a, ‘I waited for class to end as I listened to Eiichi,’ in your inner monologue, then skipping past the whole scene are you?”
“Of course not. Relax... just tell me.”
“Alright. Well, like I said, I realized...”
I waited for class to end as I pretended to listen to Eiichi.
Around twenty minutes in...
“Sorry I'm late...”
...Tokita entered the classroom looking sick to her stomach.
She was about to get shouted at by the teacher.
“I sincerely apologize. My bed tends to stalk me a bit during the winter months. Sometimes it takes a good while to persuade it to let me go...”
Her mouth seemed to be feeling fine, at least.
“......”
She stopped in front of my seat and smiled at me.
...Gah... I have a bad feeling about this.
Lunchtime rolled around.
“Hey, Eiichi. Let's go get something to eat.”
“Aah, I can't... Yuki-sama wanted to talk to me.”
“Tokita? Well, alright...”
I'll invite Tsubaki, I guess... Nah, she seems busy.
Kanon's out of the country, Usami is... sleeping...
...What about Shiratori?
Just as I thought that, my eyes met with hers.
“......”
“......”
We were caught in a Mexican standoff.
Before long, my opponent yielded and walked away dejectedly.
I couldn't shake my curiosity about what awaited me at the end of school.
As I idly wondered about it for the umpteenth time today, the last class came to an end.
“Shiratori...”
I call out to her from behind.
“...Ah.”
Shiratori looked around restlessly, as if she was worried about what our classmates might be thinking.
“Follow me.”
She walked out of the classroom.
I trod along behind her.
“Is this something you really have to hide from people?”
I try to talk to Shiratori as I blindly follow her.
“...Being seen with me would cause you trouble.”
She cast her eyes down, and a black shadow quickly fell over her expression.
More than a few of our classmates sympathized with Hashimoto.
Shiratori might feel like she has no place here anymore.
I decided to give up the conversation, and silently followed her.
The rooftop was perfectly empty.
Shiratori turned around to meet my gaze.
“Now, talk. Five minutes.”
“...Nh...”
Did she suddenly get cold feet...?
“Uh...”
“......”
She was paying a lot of attention to the railing behind her.
There was nothing there, and only the wide, orange sky beyond it.
Shiratori moved to the edge of the rooftop.
“...Suspension bridge effect... suspension bridge effect...”
She was muttering some kind of charm.
...This is suspicious.
“Uh... Valentine's Day is coming up, you know?”
“Um... y-yeah... where'd that come from?”
“Well, what do you think of when you hear ‘Valentine's Day’?”
“I think of thinking nothing.”
Oops... that jab just kinda slipped out.
“R-remember two years ago...?”
“Valentine's Day, two years ago?”
“Yeah...”
“...Nothing jumps out at me.”
I can barely remember what happened in school yesterday, let alone years ago. School just isn't a priority.
Shiratori sighed.
“...Is your forgetfulness some symptom of a greater illness?”
“I don't know. I've always been like this.”
I suddenly thought of Dr. Akimoto.
“I believe someone gave you chocolates...”
“Two years ago, you mean...?”
Hmm... I haven't got the foggiest idea.
I act cheery in school, and I get along well with my classmates, so it wouldn't be all that surprising...
“I don't remember it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.”
“It did.”
“What about it? Is this what you wanted to talk about?”
“Yeah...”
She goes sour again.
“You threw them away... straight into a rubbish bin.”
She said that with anger, then began to slip.
Shiratori, her uniform fluttering in the wind, fell toward the railing...!
“......?”
No, it [ font italic="true" ]looked[ resetfont ] like she was falling.
“W-waaah...! I'm falling～!”
She had just bent backwards a little.
It looked more like she was stretching her back than tipping over the edge.
“...S-save me...!”
“Look, you're not falling.”
“B-but... yes I am...!”
Her scream didn't hold any convincing desperation.
“Wa～!”
“‘Wa～,’ what?”
“B-but, t-the wind! The wind is sweeping me away...!”
“You could barely even call this a breeze.”
“A-a typhoon! A typhoon is coming...!”
“......”
Am I being made fun of?
Still, it didn't seem like the conversation would progress if I didn't grab her arm, so I did.
“Y-you saved me...”
“......”
“T-thanks... I was about to fall to my death.”
“......”
“Now, let's continue our chat...”
“......”
“Um...”
It seems she realized my face is dyed in anger.
“What's with you?”
“No, what's with you!?”
If she were Eiichi, I probably would have just pushed her off.
“Tch!”
I suddenly turned around and saw a woman ducking back into the rooftop's entrance. I couldn't help but think she had intended us to hear her.
“Anyway, you just up and threw away the chocolates you received!”
“Huh? Oh... did I? So?”
“...That's cruel, don't you think?”
“Haah... well, yeah, that sounds terrible.”
What kind of jerk would toss a gift from a girl into a trash can...? Oh, right, she's saying I did it.
“Who gave them to me, anyway?”
Shiratori hung her head as her shoulders trembled.
“...Ngh...”
Ah!
What!?
“H-hold on, here!”
I couldn't keep my calm.
No way, no way...!
“I... did...”
“Geh!”
“...not...”
“You did not!?”
“Uh, a-actually, I...”
She groaned a few times and gritted her teeth.
“I did――”
“NOT, idiot!!!”
She suddenly ran off.
“Good Lord, what's she doing...!?”
I heard Tokita's voice over Shiratori's noisy footsteps.
Before long, I had been left all alone.
Then, Eiichi unexpectedly appeared.
“Yo, Kyousuke... Shiratori is a good girl.”
“Huh?”
“Shiratori is a good girl.”
He repeated himself with a face like a puppet.
“Why thank you, Mr. NPC.”
“Really, seriously, she is!”
“Since when did you start singing Shiratori's praises?”
“Since Yuki-sama... I mean, uh, you know... shit happens.”
“It was the first thing you said when you came up here. That twerp Tokita trained you hard, didn't she?”
“I can't pull one over on you, can I...? You got me, Yuki-sama threatened me into doing this...”
“Doing what?”
“She told me to talk up Shiratori in front of you.”
...To talk her up?
“Sorry, Kyousuke. I don't know what came over me. I couldn't care less about Shiratori.”
“You're going to die a painful, bloody death if you don't do something about that opportunism of yours.”
...Nevertheless, I somehow understood.
It seems Shiratori gave me chocolates, which I then tossed into a trashcan.
Is that why she hated me so much...?
But hold on a minute... she gave me chocolates. And judging by her attitude, they couldn't have been just pity candy. That means...
Woah, what a twist...
“So what's the plan, Kyousuke? You still haven't finished getting your revenge on Shiratori, right?”
“Hm...”
“How about you rape her?”
“Rape, huh...?”
No, wait...
She gave me those chocolates two years ago.
Thus, Shiratori's feelings toward me are two years old.
That doesn't necessarily mean they continued into the present.
Yeah, that makes a lot more sense... the girl just called me out to complain to me.
That's all.
There was no reason for Shiratori to fall for me in the first place.
“Let's just keep a good eye on her for now.”
“Alright, leave it to me.”
“Don't go double-crossing me again.”
“Never, I swear to God.”
...He's going to do it again.
......
...
　Meanwhile, from Shiratori Mizuha's perspective...
“Waa～, Nee-san, it was no use...!”
“There, there... poor girl, poor girl.”
“He's gonna get the wrong idea again...!”
“Don't worry, Mizuha. He's not stupid, he should have understood your feelings.”
“Really?”
“I'm sure he realizes you gave him those chocolates two years ago.”
“B-but, that doesn't mean he knows I still feel that way...”
“Calm down. You're getting closer to your goal.”
“I am?”
“Of course you are! You didn't even talk to him before.”
“Right...”
“Hey, don't be so gloomy.”
“Do... do you think the suspension bridge effect worked...?”
“Hnh...!”
　The elder sister's face twisted like a drama mask.
“O-oh, definitely! Like a charm! No doubt about it!”
“Really? Thanks for teaching me about that one, Nee-san.”
“Now, next, next!”
“Next!?”
“Chase after him!”
“Eeh!? But I just...!”
“I taught you the fundamentals of the Exposure Effect, didn't I?”
“Yeah, you said I should just be around him a lot.”
“Correct, feelings of attachment to a stimulus generally monotonically increase with the number of times that stimulus is experienced.”
“But, since yesterday, we interacted a lot. Even during lunch break...”
“Interacting with a scowl won't do you any good. You have to engage him with a range of expression. Doing that causes people to mistakenly believe they've seen your inner self, ultimately providing them with a sense of intimacy.”
“...A range of expression... so I should smile, cry, grit my teeth, and look like I'm enduring humiliation?”
“...Uh... yeah, sure.”
“Got it. Anything else!?”
“Else?”
　Mizuha's older sister knit her brow with a ‘Hmm’.
“From what I've seen, I think you need to compliment him more.”
“Compliment... why? He's not really the type of person that deserves compliments...”
“But you like him, don't you?”
“...Yeah.”
“Then compliment him.”
“But if I do, he'll get all pompous.”
“Many studies in education have shown that positive reinforcement is the most effective path to results. Love is no different.”
“That's not true. Violence is the most effective path. There's no more effective means of management than violence!”
“...W-wait, where did you hear that?”
“Oh, is that wrong?”
“Say you scold someone for having bad grades. However, since the grades were initially below average, there's a high possibility that the student's next report card will show a random improvement. People will then naturally assume the negative reinforcement induced the change.”
“Oh, I get it... so if their grades are good and they get praised, and the grades drop next time, people just think it was because they got arrogant, but it actually wasn't necessarily that.”
“Well, leaving that aside, I insist that you at least try to compliment him.”
“But how am I supposed to do that...? He's two-faced.”
“Don't be so cranky. Complimenting someone is personally satisfying. It feels good.”
“Alright... got it.”
“Good, then go get him!”
...
......
...Ahhh, yet another worthless problem is trying to worm its way onto my shoulders.
“A-Azai-kun...”
A voice calls out behind me.
I turn around, startled.
“Ah, ahaha...”
Now she's laughing for some reason!
“S-sorry about earlier...”
And now she's over-dramatically dejected!
“That coat's really cool.”
For God's sake, her face and words aren't even matching up!
“...W-what? What about my coat?”
“It's incredible. Beautiful, if I must say so myself!”
“What's incredible about it? This thing's nothing but a cheap rag.”
“Uh... well, the color and stuff...”
“I'd say this is a pretty standard color for a coat.”
“Um, and your hairdo. Your bangs are really long.”
“Well, I'm sorry that bothers you.”
“Uh, no, I'm complimenting them. They're so long, they kinda look like they'd get in the way, you know?”
“What kind of compliment is that!?”
“A-and... uhhh...”
“......”
“Uhhhhhh...”
“......”
“What the hell!? You've got almost no redeeming qualities!”
She suddenly dashed off.
“Hey!”
She ran far into the distance.
...What just happened!?
“Waaaah～! Nee-san! I did it again...!”
“There, there... poor girl, poor girl.”
......
...
“Phew...”
What is going through that girl's head these days?
Today and yesterday, her behavior has been balls to the wall insane.
“...But... chocolates, huh?”
I'd have never thought she had a thing for me.
She might still...
...Well, I don't care about Shiratori's feelings.
I've no time to play around with her.
The only thing keeping me from letting all this go is one nagging question: why did she fall for me two years ago?
I don't remember being involved with Shiratori at all back then.
Still, I knew she was the heir to Shiratori Construction, so I might have tried to get on her good side...
Maybe she got the wrong idea about that...
To top it off, I threw away the chocolates she gave me...
...Hmmm. I'm quite the scoundrel.
It's not like I don't feel bad about it, but that doesn't mean I'm just going to go fall in love with her to make up for it.
This is ridiculous.
I'm going to sleep.
...Or at least I thought I was!
“Whaddya want this time!?”
“Oh, were you about to go to sleep? Sorry about that.”
“...Tokita, huh?”
“Hehe... did you think it was Mizuha?”
“Yeah, what's with her? Are you egging her on, or something?”
“How could you suggest such a thing?”
She laughed suspiciously.
“Well, what did you think?”
“About Shiratori? The word ‘creepy’ wouldn't do it justice.”
“Did she tell you about the chocolates you threw away?”
“Yeah, not that I remember anything about it...”
“Apparently Mizuha put them in your desk. She claims that as soon as you saw them, you threw them in the rubbish bin. How awful, Kyousuke.”
“...So?”
“You should pay her a little more attention.”
“No I shouldn't. I'm just not interested.”
Yeah... I should make that clear right now.
“Tell Shiratori that I'll apologize if she's still upset about two years ago, but I'm not interested in her.”
“Hmm... very well...”
Her voice seemed to be hiding something.
“Why is she so into me, anyway?”
“Oh? Who said she was still into you?”
“Mm...”
interested.”
“I mean I'm not interested ‘that way’.”
Tokita laughed.
“Hey, what exactly do you think about Mizuha?”
“I told you, I don't think anything of her.”
“Hmm... then what would you say our other classmates think of her?”
“Our classmates...? No clue...”
I casually thought back on Eiichi's investigation into Shiratori's reputation.
“They say she's the top student, good at sports... a generally talented girl, I guess. She seems to have an attitude problem, though...”
“Yet she doesn't have many friends.”
“I'd say that's about right. Ever since the Director's scandal started, she's been treated even more coldly than before.”
“Nevertheless, did you know she has a boyfriend?”
“What!?”
Talk about a freaking shock. I jumped out of bed and stood up.
But...!
“Hehe... your true feelings betray you...”
“...Hn!?”
“I was kidding, of course. The girl doesn't even have any confidants besides myself, much less a boyfriend.”
“Don't kid about things like that.”
“People allow their true selves to show when able to hide behind someone else's opinion. You're absolutely right though, she does have an attitude problem.”
...Apparently I've fallen for some sort of trap.
“Hey, don't get the wrong idea. I was just surprised at the thought of her having a boyfriend. I wasn't disappointed or anything.”
“Hmmhmm... well, I suppose not. Not yet...”
What's with ‘not yet’...?
“Either way, you seem to be concerned about her peers' treatment of her.”
“How do you work that out? I didn't say that, the other classmates did.”
“People subconsciously favor opinions that are similar to their own when reporting information. It's true that her peers are keeping her at a distance, but there are quite a few voices acknowledging her diligence, and some admiring her good looks.”
“I just happened to have missed those positive opinions, then.”
“Is that so...? I hear that first thing this morning, you asked Mizuha if she had been mobbed by the media.”
“Sure, but...”
Was that because of my personal sensitivity to the eyes of society...?
...Dammit, talking to this woman tangles up my brain.
“Look, I'm hanging up now. You don't sound like you want to talk about anything important.”
“Yes, that's enough for today.”
...Does that mean we have another session tomorrow...?
I hang up.
...This is ridiculous, seriously.
Oh well, as long as they keep it in school...
I stop thinking so hard, and go to sleep.
I actually began to look forward to the doldrums of tomorrow that would allow me to forget about things like ‘Maou’, Gonzou, and the struggles of my family.
...
......
“Mornin'...”
Tsubaki's smile was the first thing my hazy eyes saw today.
“You know, about this whole going-to-school-together thing, I didn't bring my uniform when I came over.”
Oh, right, of course she didn't.
“I'm going to go home. See you at school?”
“Yeah...”
“By the way, I made breakfast for you.”
“Oh? Really?”
Actually, something smells pretty good. I guess it's wafting in from the kitchen.
“Sorry, I'll pay you for it.”
Naturally, I went looking for my wallet.
“Ehehe, are you still asleep? Why on Earth would you have to pay me?”
“Well, I can't just eat for free...”
...Wait, why can't I?
“Umm, can I ask you something? I, well...”
After all, this girl's not just a classmate anymore.
“Yeah, you're my girlfriend.”
She's more like family.
“Oh, this'll be so much fun, Kyousuke-kun!”
A refreshing new day began.
“Hey, Kyousuke, how dare you skip yesterday!?”
“What the hell, kid? I skip all the time, and you never get on my ass like that.”
“Maybe so. But still, Tsubaki was absent too.”
“Geez...”
“Perfect little Tsubaki, missing a class? C'mon, even I was getting worried. So spill the beans, what did y'all do yesterday?”
“I wonder...?”
“Ah～!?”
“Hey. Face. Too close. I can hear you from over there.”
“Geez, and after my party was canceled... I feel Tsubaki's done nothing but string me along lately...”
“So, Tsubaki still isn't here?”
“I think she went to the faculty office.”
“Why?”
”
He started cursing with a terrifying, hilarious expression.
This joker... he may be a dumbass, but his instincts are strangely accurate.
I don't even want to think about what he's going to do after he finds out about my relationship with Tsubaki.
“Whatever. Hey, you up for club activities today?”
“Huh? Sure, why not...?”
I answered without thinking.
“Good morning, everyone～.”
Tsubaki danced into the classroom, full of energy.
“Hey, Tsubaki-chan, I was really worried about you～.”
And thus Eiichi began his flattery.
“I'm so sorry! You're talking about yesterday, right?”
“Right, I was worried. I was so worried I forgot to go buy pet food. How are you going to make it up to me?”
“S-sorry... I was talking with the teacher about this just now...”
“Yeah yeah yeah, so what happened, did you come down with something?”
“I skipped yesterday.”
“Eh? No shit?”
Tsubaki's single phrase had enough destructive power to knock Eiichi back into his true self for an instant.
“It wasn't just yesterday. Last time I was late in the morning I was skipping too, and there's no real reason for it.”
“W-wha-really? But why?”
“I wanted to have some fun.”
Tsubaki spoke without a shred of worry.
“That's why I went to the teacher and apologized just now.”
“W-whoa...”
Eiichi must've found it a little overboard that she went out of her way to do that, and I agree with him.
“I'm alright, you don't need to worry. I've been a bit moody and irritated lately, but it's all okay now.”
Tsubaki expressed a full-on smile, happily went to her seat, and started to mark the attendance.
“Hngg!”
“What the hell does ‘Hngg!’ even mean?”
“Oh God, that chick is so ridiculously moe... she's a total goody two-shoes. Ah, what am I trying to say...? Maybe she's just too radiant for an evil person like me.”
“Aren't you into older girls?”
“Aw shit, Bro, you got it all wrong. Tsubaki's got that smell of a mother-figure or an older sister who likes to take care of people. That's good stuff, man.”
“Hmm...”
“I can see it now... she'd wake up in the morning, silently prepare the toast and scrambled eggs, add some lettuce...”
“......”
I couldn't help but stay quiet.
“Ah!?　Whaaat!?”
“N-nothing... dammit kid, will you get your face out of mine?”
Before long, we were eating lunch at the usual place.
After arriving early at the rooftop, Usami called to me.
“Thanks for everything up until now.”
“What do you mean, ‘Thanks?’ If you were grateful, you wouldn't have accused me of being a criminal.”
“You mean you aren't the kidnapper?”
“You're stubborn, you know that? Do you have any proof at all?”
“No.”
Usami was playing with her bangs, as always.
“What do you think? About my deductions, I mean.”
“What do I think...? If you're not confident about it, then don't start spouting it.”
“No way, you were the one acting all, ‘you have to tell me, no matter what.’ You forced it out of me.”
“Look, I don't care. Just don't suspect me again, okay?”
“I'm sorry, it's just that it would explain so much if you were the culprit, so I just...”
Usami's hair lowered and began to swing like willow branches.
“Haru-chan, could I borrow you for a sec?”
Tsubaki called to us from afar.
“Oh?”
“What, Usami?”
“Nothing, I just think Tsubaki looks like she's feeling a lot better.”
Tsubaki jogged over to Usami.
“Haru-chan, I'm sorry.”
Tsubaki suddenly bowed a bit.
“Hm?”
“I snapped at you a lot recently, didn't I?”
“......”
“But all you ever did, Haru-chan, was try your best to help me.”
“......”
“You looked through condemned buildings with all your strength, right? Dad told me that those aren't places a girl should be in all alone...”
Usami was silent for a moment, then solemnly opened her mouth.
“I feel the same. I won't push you into calling the police anymore.”
“Oh? Really?”
“I have no right to reproach you for fearing the kidnapper's reprisal. I've sincerely reflected on that.”
“......”
“I'm sorry I was unable to help.”
I alone tilted my head quizzically.
Usami will pursue rationality wherever it may lead her.
She probably realizes that even if they became involved, the police would say it's much too late now that things have progressed this far.
There's been a decent amount of time since the incident.
As the victims, Tsubaki and her family probably don't remember it vividly enough for testimonies, and ‘Maou’ might have destroyed all evidence already.
“Haru-chan, I said some horrible things to you. I'm truly sorry. But I'm fine now, so can we make up?”
...It'd probably be best for me to leave.
There was nothing for me to do in the classroom either, so I thought of sending a text message to Tsubaki.
No, knowing her, there's no chance she actually brought her phone to school.
...I'll just call Miki-chan.
“Kyousuke-kun!”
“Hh, what!?”
“Why are you so surprised? Oh, were you talking on the phone?”
“Gh, um... are you finished talking to Usami already?”
“Yup, Haru-chan said she forgives me.”
“That's great... Usami was being pretty annoying, but you were acting a bit strange yourself.”
“I really feel bad about the way I've been to Haru-chan.”
Her voice just got quieter and quieter.
“I think... I think I was just really jealous.”
“Every time I thought about whether or not Haru-chan liked you, Kyousuke, I became so nervous that I couldn't even sit down.”
...I even invited Usami to my room once.
“I thought you might have been worried about that.”
“At first I thought, ‘I shouldn't be thinking like this,’ but in the middle of it all I realized there was nothing wrong with thinking about it. In the end, I suddenly felt like I just couldn't forgive her, and I got frustrated.”
“Oh, well. It was a good experience at least, right?”
“Yeah, though I wouldn't want to go through it again.”
She cheerfully stuck out her tongue.
“Can I see you again today?”
“Uhm? Yeah, sure...”
I hesitated, but there was no reason to refuse.
“Oh, but I won't be available until late tonight. There are some things I need to take care of.”
Some insignificant things like club activities.
“No problem, no problem. I have a lot on my list, too. First, I need to pick up Hiroaki and Sae and get them home, then I have to bring Mom to the hospital...”
...Sounds exhausting.
“Of course, the thing I'm most behind on is my diary.”
She flipped it open and perused it for a moment.
“Oh yeah, don't you always have bread for lunch?”
“Yeah...”
“You think I could make you lunch from tomorrow on?”
Tsubaki asked my permission, embarrassed.
I too was afraid that someone in the class would hear.
...I don't usually like attention.
“So... is that a no?”
Still, in the face of that fawning voice, I couldn't help but nod.
“No, it's a yes. That'd be great.”
I answered curtly.
“Thanks! I love you so much!”
My knees almost buckled.
I was planning to remind her to not expose our relationship, but thanks to her declaration, I forgot.
I didn't feel quite right for the rest of the day.
And yet I still ended up going to the club.
...
......
“Bees.”
“Flying, honey-making insects.”
“Babies.”
“Prodigal progeny, fruits of my loins.”
“Rabies.”
“Very scary.”
“Wannabes.”
“Yeah!!”
“Hello, everyone. The role of God this week will again be played by me, Azai Kyousuke.”
“Wow～.”
“Ooh～.”
“I'm so excited.”
“Totally～!”
“Hey, what the hell is Usami doing here!?”
“Huh?”
“Hey, Eiichi! I thought this lab equipment storage room was our Jerusalem!”
“Jerusalem...”
“Looks like the Lord just can't hold back his bad jokes today.”
“Too bad～.”
“What the...? What's with you two? Are you in this together?”
“I've been in the Etekichi Faction all along.”
“There are factions now? Whatever, what do you want today, human scum?”
“What we want, is, well, yeah.”
“Yeah!”
“Ah? How disgusting. Stop beating around the bush and repent.”
“Anyway, Eiichi-san, go finish him.”
“Okay～!”
“W-wait. You intend to rebel against God?”
“Then let me say it.”
“Say it, say it.”
“I heard a rumor that just like a certain Azai Kyousuke had hoped, he held a squeezing session with Tsubaki.”
“Gah!!!”
“Hmm? Does this mean the rumors are true? Go finish him, Eiichi-san.”
“Okay okay～.”
“W-wait wait wait, what on Earth are you talking about!?”
“It'll be painful to watch if you deny it at this point. Go finish...”
“I said WAIT!”
“All the material is prepared.”
“Material?”
“That means evidence.”
“I know that, asshole. What kind of material is it? Talk.”
“Hehehe.”
“Heeheehee.”
“Elementary, my dear Holmes.”
“Who are you? Who are you to present your opinions to Holmes?”
“Oh, no, Tsubaki just...”
“Right～.”
“Tsubaki just...?”
“...Blatantly announced it.”
“That she was Kyousuke-kun's girlfriend!”
“Gah!!!”
“She said such a thing to me so suddenly...”
“Eh, well, it's because she's like that that she's so moe.”
“Whawhy, in front of everyone...? Tsubaki... damn, it's all over now. I should have told her...”
is your only excuse? In that case, go finish him now, Fr*eza-san.”
“First you talk down to Holmes, now you command Fr*eza?”
......
...
“Bye.”
He leaves me with a glare, as if looking at something dirty.
“H-hey, wait.”
“Haaaaa... Kyousuke, I'm really disappointed in you.”
With a sigh full of deep contempt, Eiichi fled the storage room.
“Azai-san...”
“What do you want, you bitch? Have you not done enough damage already?”
“Oh, I've done plenty. But you picked Tsubaki, huh?”
“You got a problem with that?”
“Tsubaki is one of my few friends, so please make her happy.”
...This whole thing is becoming quite the nightmare.
“Well, leave the rest of it to me.”
“What are you talking about? The rest of what?”
“You know, things like ‘Maou’.”
“I thought you were convinced I was ‘Maou’?”
Usami's always so aloof, so I have no idea what she's thinking about.
“Think back to when the ransom was taken, for instance. You still remember it, don't you? I was played beautifully when I took that empty case, yes... but after a little ex-post-facto reflection, I was able to discover a few clues.”
“I'm ‘Maou’, and I copied the coin locker key beforehand, right?”
“Hehe. Well, I can't fully exclude the possibility.”
I can't deal with this chick anymore.
“Well. I'm going out with Tsubaki. This shouldn't have anything to do with you.”
“......”
After pausing for a few seconds,
Usami finally, softly, nodded.
“Can I say just one thing?”
The atmosphere wouldn't permit a refusal.
Just what is it with her?
“You have to be happy, Kyousuke-kun...”
The girl before me said this with a slightly lonely expression.
“......”
Usami turned around and left.
She never turned back.
A lonely feeling welled up within me, but it was only temporary.
I'm very forgetful, after all.
The feeling of nostalgia I experienced from Usami calling out my name would surely soon disappear into the farthest reaches of my memory.
I left school and headed for Tsubaki's house.
The moment I arrived, I was mobbed by her family.
“Aaah, you came～?”
“The boyfriend's here～.”
“W-wait a second, get off me...”
“Azai-kun, welcome! Have you eaten?”
“You don't have to ask him, girl. Eat here, Son. You're already a member of our family.”
“...Pardon?”
Please, God...
“Hey, Tsubaki, please don't tell me that even your dad...?”
I asked her in almost a whisper.
“Yup. It'd be weird to hide something like that from Dad.”
She answered with a smile.
“Fine, but why'd you tell Eiichi and Usami?”
“Huh? Was I not supposed to?”
“...I guess there's no reason you shouldn't...”
Oh, well. It would've gotten out someday, anyway.
Might as well give up.
“Thanks for inviting me.”
“No problem, Azai-kun... no, maybe I'll call you Kyousuke.”
“Haha...”
“Kyousuke-oniichan! You gotta take care'a Sis, 'kay?”
“Take care'a her～!”
This house really has a lively atmosphere.
The kids chimed in under the father's leadership.
“Kyousuke-kun, have some more. The dinner won't bite back.”
A mountain of rice sat on the table.
“Onee-chan's going to get married～!”
“Really? I'm so happy～!”
“......”
I ate without a sound.
“How's the food?”
Tsubaki just kept looking at me.
Dinner was beef and potato stew.
“...It's good.”
“Honestly? I'm so glad you like it.”
“......”
The atmosphere is rapidly becoming awkward.
I can't help feeling out of place here.
“See Dad, Kyousuke likes my beef and potato stew.”
“Really, Kyousuke-kun? She's not blackmailing you?”
“Haha...”
Not sure how to respond to that one.
In any case, eating with her parents on our first day as a couple is kinda...
As these random thoughts filled my head, Tsubaki just kept on looking at me with a smile.
“Wh-what?”
“You hold your chopsticks in a really bizarre way...”
“Ah, he totally does～!”
“Bizarre～!”
“He's a bad kid～!”
“Hey, it's not like I'm doing things the hard way or anything.”
“You say that, but the rice sticking to your face says otherwise.”
“......”
“I'll lick it off.”
“W-wha...?”
In front of her parents...!?
Tsubaki's father, along with Tsubaki herself, burst out laughing.
“Ehehe, I saw yet another interesting side of you just now.”
“Don't write about this in your diary, you hear?”
“I totally will! There's a whole chapter devoted to you, you know.”
“Whoa, that's pretty scary.”
Damn, something must be wrong with me.
I just cannot function well in a warm environment like this one.
“...Ah, excuse me, Sir, are you still using the soy sauce?”
“Come on now, call me Dad, won't you? Why're you holding back?”
“A-aah...”
“Kyousuke-kun, do you have any interests?”
“Huh? Pardon?”
“He's into classical music, Dad.”
“Ah, Beethoven.”
“Um, yeah... a couple others, too...”
“Other guys, I see... ah, like Kitajima Saburou, the folk singer?”
“......”
How on earth am I supposed to answer that?
“Yeah, uh... I'm also into computers and such...”
Tsubaki's father hit his palm with a fist.
“Ah, you mean like Twitter.”
He looked so proud of himself that I couldn't bring myself to correct him.
“Som-something like that.”
“Hey, Onii-chan. Can I have some of your meat?”
“Hey, Hiroaki. Don't just eat the beef. You have to eat your vegetables, too!”
“It's really lively here...”
“Ah, Mom, you woke up?”
“How can I sleep after hearing that my daughter's got a boyfriend?”
“Hello, my name is Azai Kyousuke.”
“I heard. You've taken care of Tsubaki so many times. You even saved me when I needed to get to the hospital.”
“Please... I only called a taxi.”
“You can always count on Kyousuke, Mom. You should thank him some more, he pretty much saved your life.”
“Don't exaggerate, now...”
“No, I'm truly grateful.”
“Don't worry about it...”
“Oh, do you have any interests, Kyousuke-kun?”
“Dad just asked that.”
“Honey, he's into Twitter.”
As my words left me, the phone rang.
“Ah, excuse me for a moment.”
It's a call from a client.
“What, are you tweeting?”
“Dad, shush.”
“Oh, right. A phone call. Everyone, pipe down!”
“Ooooh～!”
“Oooh～!”
What a unified family.
“......”
...I'll call back later.
“Huh? Done already?”
“No, looks like they hung up.”
“Dangit, it's all because everyone was too loud.”
“Oh, I'm sorry.”
“Kyousuke-kun has a really busy job. The next time he gets a call, everyone has to be quiet.”
“'Kaay!”
“'Kaay!”
Apparently neither her siblings nor her parents will go against her.
“Ah, well... you don't have to worry about me, let's just try to enjoy our time together.”
That doesn't sound like me at all...
“Kyousuke-kun, what's got you so smiley?”
“Hm?”
“Eh, I guess I shouldn't prod. In a home with nothing, the fact that you can smile is worth more than anything else.”
“...Right.”
“I'm glad you're smiling, Kyousuke-kun.”
As she said these words, she brought rice-laden chopsticks to my mouth.
“Here, eat.”
“......”
Argh, she's so sweet she's giving me a toothache.
......
...
...Despite everything, even if they don't have a cent to their name, this family shines.
“Kyousuke-kun, do you want another bowl?”
“Sorry... I'm completely stuffed.”
Tsubaki busily changed her brothers' and sisters' clothes, washed them, and coaxed them to sleep.
Only her father and I were left in the living room.
“So... you've not only helped us as a family, but now you've also decided to take care of Tsubaki.”
The two of us going out has already become a pretense for our marriage.
“How is everything? Have your preparations for the big move been going smoothly?”
“Yeah, we're just about packed and ready. Besides the living room here, the entire house is desolate.”
“You've left the living room for last?”
“Yeah. Since this is where the whole family gathers, we thought it should be our final bastion.”
“......”
His eyes wandered around the room, full of emotion.
My gaze followed his.
There are tear-marks all over the tatami, and the walls all have holes.
“Ah, this really takes me back.”
Tsubaki's dad poured himself another drink.
“Look there, do you see that wooden girder on the ceiling?”
“Mm... yeah, you mean the one that's a little darker than the rest...?”
“A little burned, you mean.”
He suddenly started laughing.
“We were having a hotpot, and Tsubaki managed to start a fire. It was nothing serious, but... oh, boy, it was really too much.”
“So even Tsubaki can be careless.”
“She was born careless... but she sure has grown up. Since our family's so big, maybe she felt particularly pressured to become a reliable adult.”
“You think...?”
After that, Tsubaki's father went silent.
Maybe he's normally a person who doesn't talk much.
“Kyousuke-kun...”
“Ah, yes?”
Suddenly, he met my gaze.
“Can I talk to you for a bit?”
“Huh...?”
I have a bad feeling about this.
What if he plans to say that he doesn't want to give up this house?
Will he try to use me, his daughter's boyfriend, to get the house back?
“You, uh... you don't eat with your family often, do you?”
“...Did Tsubaki say that?”
He slowly shook his head.
“I noticed it myself when we were eating. You wouldn't eat until I picked up my chopsticks, and you wouldn't touch the soy sauce until I'd used it.”
“...Did I do that?”
It must have been out of habit.
“Are those so-called ‘table manners’?”
“Perhaps.”
“Save 'em for another table. There's no need for stuff like that in our home.”
“Huh...?”
“You're right around Tsubaki's age, but your eyes are nothing like my daughter's.”
“What's different about me?”
“Absolutely everything. Haven't people mentioned this to you before?”
“Who knows...?”
Hearing my muddled answer, Tsubaki's father unexpectedly sighed.
“You've faced many things in the past, and you're facing many things still. Am I right?”
“......”
“If you ever feel lost, or lonely... please, come to our home.”
Complicated feelings flooded my heart.
...What benefit can I receive from a penniless bunch like you?
Yet... why would such an ordinary, happy family reach out to someone like me?
I don't understand.
But I don't have to understand it to realize how comfortable this feeling is.
“About the debt...”
“Ah, yes.”
Finally, a subject in my element.
“How is it going? I imagine it must be difficult...”
“Yeah. I'm gathering funds right now, and I might need to discuss things with you again in the near future.”
“I understand. To tell you the truth, I'm much better at handling subjects like this.”
“Hahaha. Is having a huge family gathering like this difficult for you?”
“Heh, maybe it is...”
I couldn't help but smile wryly.
If only I met people like the Miwas when Mother and I were wandering...
If there had just been one single warm, passionate person like this...
Wiping away the pointless delusion, I chatted with Tsubaki's father for a while.
...
......
“Thanks for coming.”
When I announced my departure, Tsubaki walked me to the door.
“Did you have a good time?”
“Yeah...”
Again, I looked down and scratched my head.
“Does it always feel like this?”
“Hmm?”
“I mean, the kidnapping just happened, so it must have disturbed the rhythm of the house. Is it normally like this?”
“Yeah. Too noisy for you?”
“...No...”
What am I trying to say?
“If you like it, why not come here every day?”
“See you tomorrow, then...”
“Huh? Tomorrow?”
“I thought that was an invitation.”
Tsubaki puffed out her cheeks.
“Hehehe, of course it was. Fantastic, now we can see each other tomorrow, too.”
“There's no school tomorrow, so I'll make it happen somehow during a break from work.”
“Work? Do you need my help?”
“Nah, I'll be fine. Anyway, don't you have things to do here?”
“I'll make it happen somehow, too. Please, I insist.”
“Great then, I appreciate it...”
I started considering which tasks to give her.
“Then come by tomorrow afternoon. You can do the same things as before.”
“All I want is to be able to help you, Kyousuke-kun. It's my own personal happiness.”
I can't believe she can actually spout lines that belong in a TV drama without even batting an eyelash.
“Ah, right, right, Kyousuke-kun.”
Tsubaki suddenly waved me back.
“What?”
“I want to tell you about the secret entrance to the house.”
“Huh?”
“......”
“How about it? This way you can get in, even if you don't have a key.”
She showed me how to get in by putting specific pressure on the rickety back door.
“Wait a minute, Tsubaki, you shouldn't be telling outsiders about this.”
“You're absolutely right. Good thing I don't see any outsiders around here.”
“......”
“According to Dad, you're as good as family. I think so, too.”
“It's too early to talk about that.”
“You're welcome anytime.”
...Aren't they about to move anyway?
“Alright, thanks. How about I sneak in during the night and scare you?”
“Ah, that sounds interesting. I'm sure my siblings would get a kick out of it.”
Jesus, there should be a limit to her defenselessness.
“See you tomorrow.”
“Ah, sorry, I kept you for far too long.”
“......”
“But... I'm just so happy when you smile, Kyousuke-kun.”
“Is it really that rare?”
“Yup.”
...Come to think of it, when was the last time I laughed from my heart?
“See ya...”
“Ah, yeah...”
She's really not eager to see me go.
Hesitating for just a moment, Tsubaki pressed her body against mine.
She grabbed the sleeve of my coat.
“...What is it?”
“Uh, um...”
“Hm?”
“...P-please...?”
Tsubaki closed her eyes, waiting for something.
“......”
My lips felt a moistness upon them, as if something had melted from within my heart.
“Th-thank you...”
Tsubaki immediately pulled away.
“B-bye, be careful on the road...”
She almost tripped as she all but jumped back in her house.
“......”
I don't quite know what to do with the warmth these people bring to my heart.
Even though the night was freezing, it didn't snow on my way home.
...
......
First thing the next morning, my cell phone suddenly rang.
Still dazed and sleepy, I woke up.
“Tsubaki...?”
“A-Azai-kun, I'm really sorry about calling you at this time!”
“What time is it?”
It seems like Tsubaki has been trying to reach me for a while now.
“Four in the morning. Sorry, but there's something that I have to talk to you about, no matter what.”
The sun hasn't even risen yet.
I got home at around two this morning. That means I only slept for two hours.
“What is it?”
“The person who kidnapped Hiroaki contacted us. He told my father to change all fifty million into stocks and have Usami-san wait in the yard this evening and...”
“S-slow down. Calm down. Calm down and say it slowly.”
My head still hurt from being awoken by this racket.
“Wait, stocks?”
Not cash?
“Yes, fifty thousand shares.”
“Which stock?”
“He said Shiratori Construction. Isn't that Shiratori the same as our classmate Shiratori?”
“That's right. Shiratori's father is the director of our school.”
But... why Shiratori Construction?
“And Usami is supposed to wait in your yard this evening?”
“Well, he said she should do that after we finish preparing the shares.”
Why Usami?
“I don't understand what this guy's thinking at all, but I can guess why you called. You want me to take care of the money?”
“Yes. Dad isn't familiar with stocks at all, and he's never borrowed money from the bank...”
“I see. Did you call the police?”
“No, definitely not!”
In almost a scream.
“Huh? Did something else happen?”
“Last night, around ten, a package arrived at our house.”
...I have a bad feeling about this.
“...What was inside?”
Tsubaki spoke as softly as the buzz of a mosquito. It was almost inaudible.
“A-a photo of Hiroaki, and...”
“A photo?”
“...and, h-hair...”
“......”
“Is he saying that if we tell the police, he'll cut off something else next time!?”
Yes, that's exactly what he's saying.
But hair isn't such a big deal.
I thought that it'd be a finger or something.
“I'm way too scared to call the police. I'm already lost about what to do, that's why I called you.”
“I got it. I'll try to work things out on the money side.”
“Th-thank you...”
“Tomorrow... er, wait, today, I guess. We need fifty thousand shares by this evening, right?”
“Yes.”
To do that, we'd need fifty one-thousand-share stock certificates.
“We need to make the purchase before noon... but, can we even get fifty thousand shares...?”
“Will it be difficult?”
“I'm pretty sure you'd need more than fifty million yen.”
“H-how much do we need?”
“I'll go ahead and check Shiratori Construction's closing price from last weekend after this call... but yeah, including broker fees and miscellaneous charges, fifty million probably won't be enough.”
“A-about that, I asked Dad, and we still have around ten million in savings...”
“Wow...”
To have such a huge family and still maintain this amount in savings... means he's really been working hard.
“Got it. Then we'll just have to get fifty million.”
“Will it be possible?”
“It shouldn't be a problem. I already brought it up yesterday.”
“Are we borrowing from the bank?”
“No, from a branch company of my father's. If we barged into a bank and asked for fifty million yen, there's no way we'd get the money, especially not before noon.”
...However, it would be possible if the police were there.
“Alright, I'll be over in a bit. Please have your father prepare the deed and his seal.”
I finished it in one breath.
“Deed...?”
“Yeah.”
“That's... what's this all about?”
“I'm sorry, but this is the only way.”
“What are they going to do to the land?”
“Fifty million isn't a small sum. If you don't put up any collateral, you won't be able to get the loan.”
“But that means... what'll happen if we can't pay?”
“The land will belong to your lender...”
Tsubaki interrupted me.
“We'll be forced to move?”
“...Yes.”
“How can this be...? Isn't there any other way?”
I can imagine how uneasy that would make her.
“Well, if you loaned money to someone else, but they couldn't promise that they could pay it back, would you still give them the money?”
“...Well, if that person's trustworthy...”
“...Ha.”
I'm digging my own grave here...
Tsubaki would loan money to people sleeping on the street.
“Ah, sorry. I was the one asking you for help, but I'm not going along with it...”
“Don't worry about it. This is all such a shock, I'm sure you're panicking right now.”
I went straight to the point.
“Anyway, it doesn't need to be asked whether you'd choose your land or your brother's life.”
“......”
“You can't buy a life with money, after all.”
It wasn't a line that came easy to me.
“I understand. I'll talk to Dad about it.”
“Ah, you have to contact me by seven in the morning at the latest. If you're any later than that, I can't guarantee that I can get the money.”
“I'm really very grateful for this, Azai-kun.”
“No problem.”
“I'm a little bit relieved. It's really great to have such a reliable person on our side.”
She's probably smiling on the other end of the line.
“I think I've gained some courage. Bye.”
The call disconnected.
I don't feel any emotion.
The development of the Eastern District is an important job entrusted to me by the Sannou Corporation.
That's the only thing I should think about.
“But still, stocks...”
I should go and ask someone who's familiar with it...
“Hello, this is Azai. I'm sorry about calling at this time...”
“Yes, I wanted to get your input on something...”
The moment I mentioned Shiratori Construction, his reaction changed.
“It's best to avoid it...? Hmm... ah, yes... the price is going down...?”
“...You don't know the reason?”
“Ah... so, if the price drops anymore...”
In this case, getting fifty thousand shares isn't going to be hard at all.
“Thank you very much. Yes, Father wishes the best for you as well.”
Still, I wonder what's going on with Shiratori Construction?
The Shiratori girl's face flashed before my eyes.
That arrogant attitude.
That forceful demeanor and those pleading eyes.
“......”
...It has nothing to do with me.
I walked back into my study.
...
......
In the end, Tsubaki accepted my help.
After putting the land and his son's life on opposite sides of the scale, her stubborn father finally gave in.
Ever since this morning, I've been running around, gathering the money.
The fifty million was received effortlessly.
I'd talked to Gonzou beforehand, told him my plans, and the collateral was accepted without a hitch.
Tsubaki's father took the borrowed fifty million and the Miwa family's entire savings and put it all in a newly-opened account at the stock exchange.
The certificates for the fifty thousand shares should be delivered before evening.
On the way to Tsubaki's house, my headache struck once more.
Maybe it's because I'm working too much...
......
...
“Azai-san, are you okay?”
“Hmm? Ah, what?”
“Your headache seems really serious.”
“I'm fine...”
“Really? You don't look like yourself right now.”
“Do I not?”
“No, you look like you've sold your soul to the Devil... or is it just me?”
My soul was pawned off a long time ago.
Everything's going according to plan.
The ransom must be delivered successfully.
Dammit, Usami, I won't let you interfere...
“Now that we're on the subject, why me?”
Six o'clock rolled around.
In accordance with instructions, Usami was standing in front of Tsubaki's front door.
“How am I supposed to know? I'm curious myself.”
Usami looked around, so anxious that she couldn't sit still.
“Actually, the question I should ask is why are you waiting with me, Azai-san?”
“Who cares...?”
I know I'm being persistent about this, but I'm here to keep an eye out for police.
For instance, if some of the neighbors grew suspicious, there would be a chance that they might call the authorities.
I pretended to chat with Usami, while on alert for an unmarked police car or a detective on a stakeout.
“Oh, well. While we're talking, have you ever considered this?”
“What, our future together?”
“......”
I was just joking, but Usami's face turned darker.
“You're in a really good mood, considering this is a situation where your friend is going through such misfortune.”
“That's exactly why I'm acting like this. If we were depressed, how would she get through this herself?”
“Even so, it was an awfully strange joke to tell someone you don't even like being around.”
“Sorry that it wasn't funny.”
“Forget it. Anyway, why do you think ‘Maou’ wanted stocks for a ransom instead of cash?”
“Wait, did you just say ‘Maou’?”
“Yes.”
“The kidnapper is that ‘Maou’?”
“There's a high possibility.”
“Any evidence?”
“Didn't he say that he'll call me and leave instructions?”
...Interesting.
“‘Maou’ is the only person who knows about my cell, because he was the one that gave it to me.”
...Hmmm, not bad at all.
I spoke, feigning disinterest.
“I know too, you know.”
“Huh? What do you know?”
A stupid look surfaced on her face.
“The fact that you have a cell phone.”
“Oh, didn't I tell you that I don't have one? Don't you remember how I borrowed one from you on Central Boulevard?”
“Is your mind somewhere else today? Didn't you have a warm-up with ‘Maou’ a couple days ago? You told me yourself.”
“......”
“Are you listening?”
“Ah, right... I forgot. Right, so Azai-san knows, right, right...”
As she nods her head, her piercing eyes let loose a bizarre gleam.
“Ah, I'm just throwing this out there, but I've been watching the surroundings. Absolutely no one has appeared.”
“Erm...”
“Not even a car has passed by.”
I know what Usami wants to say.
This woman is something else...
“Are you trying to say that I'm ‘Maou’?”
“Ah, no, no. I don't mean it that way. After all, he might be watching us from a discreet location with a telescope.”
“Hey, don't we have an agreement to never suspect each other?”
“Right, of course. You're innocent, Azai-san.”
Despite what she said, I can only take this to be her suspecting me...
“But, and this is just a guess, maybe ‘Maou’ is another student in our school, or something.”
“Oh...?”
“Eh, just a guess.”
“You mean there's no evidence?”
“Well, the kidnapper's call came at night, and the game that he played with me was on a Sunday.”
“Haha... that really is a wild guess. Wouldn't ‘Maou’ have a similar schedule if he was working an office job?”
“Ah, right. That's logical and justified. And ‘Maou’ is quite wealthy, too.”
...This girl...
“He has enough power to order people to put graffiti wherever he wants it, and he must have come in a car when he took Hiroaki-kun.”
“......”
“Plus, he wants stocks for the ransom. That means he's even very knowledgeable about money.”
“......”
“A student sure wouldn't fit all that, huh?”
“Heheh...”
I can't help but laugh.
“What, is something funny?”
“No, no. I was just thinking that you, Usami, are a very interesting person.”
“Really? I'm really not used to being complimented, so don't spoil me too much, okay?”
I was reminded of the reason for my desire to thoroughly crush her.
“Can we get back to the main topic?”
“Ah, sure. Were we talking about using stocks as the ransom?”
“What do you think?”
“I don't know...”
“Don't feign ignorance. You must have seen something in it.”
Let me see just how good you are...
“The first thing that comes to mind is the ease of transportation.”
“Fifty million in cash is, in all likelihood, five thousand ten-thousand-yen bills. Stock certificates, though, can be quite a bit more valuable per slip. We've only got fifty certificates in there.”
With only a few exceptions, stock certificates come in units of one thousand shares.
If we have fifty thousand shares, then there are only fifty certificates.
“Makes sense. Since the guy's planning on taking the ransom and hightailing it out of there, he'd want the goods to be as light as possible.”
“But if transportation was really the only reason, there are a variety of other, better methods that he could've enlisted.”
“For instance?”
“Exchanging the cash for diamonds or other precious stones.”
“Hmm...”
“And he specifically asked for Shiratori Construction shares. Why?”
“Dunno... maybe the criminal believes Shiratori Construction's stock will go up in value.”
Usami heaved a sigh.
“And there's something else.”
“It seems odd that he gave Tsubaki's family less than a day to prepare fifty million yen and purchase stocks with it. Don't you think that's a little unreasonable for normal people like the Miwas?”
“What would he have done if they couldn't pull it off?”
“Twisting that thought around, it might mean that he had reason to believe they could. What do you think?”
“I dunno... maybe he thought that they'd try their hardest no matter what since their child is on the line.”
Usami doesn't seem to agree.
“If they had the help of the authorities, they should be able to get the money smoothly enough. Yet ‘Maou’ persistently warns them not to call the police.”
“Obviously. Not too many kidnappers want to fight the police.”
“Am I right when I say that it would've been impossible without your help?”
“Probably. The culprit must have thoroughly researched everyone connected to the family.”
Usami's eyes blinked twice, three times, and finally closed tightly.
“Azai-san...”
“Hmm?”
“This is what I feel:”
She opened her eyes.
“I think this kidnapping was just a way to provoke me.”
“Oh...?”
“If that wasn't the case, I don't see why he'd want to contact them using my cell.”
She's right... if he wanted to, he could easily confine his contact to the Miwa family alone.
“Well... it's about time for me to head out.”
“Out?”
“Sorry, but I still have things to take care of.”
“I see. When will you be coming back?”
“I've got things going on until tomorrow evening.”
“And naturally those things going on are more important than the crisis Tsubaki is facing, right?”
“Don't say it like that. Even if I stay, what can I do?”
“I don't know, but right now, you're the only one that Tsubaki can lean on...”
“Alright... just contact me if anything happens.”
“I will. Immediately.”
I turned around.
Usami kept her vigil in front of the door, her thoughts racing.
Okay, what needs to be done next...?
　Tsubaki sat on the floor with knees bent, sighing out her feelings of tension and despair.
　Her brother had been kidnapped for two days now, but to Tsubaki it had already felt like an eternity.
　She's taking time off of school by pretending to be sick.[l] Even though lying hurts like a knife in her heart, she can't tell the school the truth.
“Tsubaki, go rest a bit. You haven't slept in two days.”
　Her father spoke, a haggard expression adorning his features.
“Th-there's no need to worry about me. Is Mom okay?”
　Her mother isn't feeling well.[l] When she heard of the kidnapping two nights ago, she fainted on the spot.
　Three of her siblings are sleeping in another room.[l] When they learned of Hiroaki's absence, they screamed and cried.[l] Even though they've been told that Hiroaki is at their grandmother's house, the kids are sharp.[l] They've probably noticed the gravity of the situation through the heavy atmosphere.
　This family used to be cheerful, always full of smiles.[l] The mother; physically weak, but good at cooking.[l] The children; always arguing about this or that.[l] The father; stubborn on the outside, but fond of doting on his daughter...
　――Why did this have to happen?
　The sighing won't stop.[l] This misfortune is just cruel.[l] Why did the kidnapper pick us?[l] And why Hiroaki?[l] What could be happening to him, right now as I sit here?[l] If I could, I would take his place.
　Even so, Tsubaki has already decided not to show weakness before either her family or the culprit.[l] Right now, the ones in the most pain are her father who had to give up his prized land and her mother who had the child that she carried for nine months taken away.
“Looks like it's time...”
　The sound of a cell phone mingled with Haru's low voice as it echoed around the narrow family room.[l] What's the culprit trying to achieve, calling Haru's phone?
　Tsubaki watched Haru.[l] She brought the cell up to her ear in a calm fashion.[l] Her expression was dignified.[l] She was no longer the Usami Haru Tsubaki had met at school, her timid back hunched over like a willow branch.
“Is this ‘Maou’?”
　Haru suddenly spoke.[l] What does ‘Maou’ mean?[l] Not even an iota of humor accompanied Haru's absurd question.[l] Tsubaki, on the other hand, was completely confused.
“That's some greeting. What are you trying to accomplish?”
　What are they talking about?[l] Tsubaki's mind is immersed in chaos.[l] This interaction makes it sound like Haru and the kidnapper know each other.
“...Got it. I'll get Tsubaki.”
　Having her name suddenly called almost made Tsubaki jump out of her skin.
“M-me?”
“He told me to give this to you. From now on, this cell will be in your care.”
　Haru handed over the phone after finishing this sentence.
　Tsubaki gulped.[l] She took the phone, still on the line.[l] Her hands were shaking uncontrollably.[l] She has to speak with the kidnapper once again.[l] Closing her eyes, she pulled the phone up to her ear.
“Hi, it's Tsubaki...”
“How are you?”
　The voice was different.[l] This wasn't a robotic voice like before, but the unadulterated voice of a man.
“Wh-what do you want?”
“I'm very grateful that you haven't called the police. It looks like I'll be able to have a trusting business relationship with you, Tsubaki.”
　It was a strange feeling,[l] the kidnapper addressing her by her first name...
“The ransom has been prepared. What are we supposed to do next?”
“Excellent. As long as you follow my instructions, your brother will be returned to you.”
　‘Maou’ then gave her his next instructions.
“First, make sure that this cell is charged at all times. Go to an electronics store and buy a charger. Make sure to match the models.”
　Tsubaki quickly opened her diary and wrote down the directions.
“There's a mall on Central Boulevard called Yamatoya, do you know it?”
　Facing a sudden question, Tsubaki sank into confusion.
“Um, well... I think so.”
“On the third floor, there's a store that sells handbags.”
“R-right.”
“Tomorrow morning, go there and buy the cheapest briefcase available. Ten thousand yen should be enough.”
“Briefcase...”
　She wrote furiously, not having even a second to question the kidnapper.
“After you buy it, put the stock certificates in an envelope in the briefcase and contact me. My number should be in the phone that you're holding right now.”
　After writing everything down thoroughly, Tsubaki finally got a chance to take a breath.
　Tsubaki thought to herself.[l] Why does he want me to do all these roundabout things?[l] I didn't call the police, and I'll give him the ransom just like he wants.[l] So please, just return my brother.
“Umm...”
　The thoughts in her heart slipped out.
“I'll really give you the money. I mean, I'll definitely give it to you. So...”
　The kidnapper interrupted her.
“I'll definitely return your brother.”
“Ah, yes...”
“I'm only hoping that the transaction will follow through without a hitch. Is there any proof that you won't call the police tomorrow?”
“I won't!”
　She instinctively yelled a response.
“Why don't you believe me!?”
“Let me ask you this, rather. Why should I trust you?”
“If I said I'm not going to do it, then I won't!”
　Laughter came from the other end of the line.
“You know, Tsubaki...”
　A voice almost like a whisper swirled around her ears.
“...you really are something else.”
“Wh-what?”
“It's your right to trust others unconditionally if you want to, but would you mind not forcing that on me?”
“I don't understand what you mean.”
“You're an amazing girl. I love people like you.”
　Tsubaki was speechless.[l] Not a single word would come out.[l] The culprit spoke again to the befuddled Tsubaki.
“I was thinking of having your father do the exchange instead, but I've made up my mind. I want you to do it.”
　The exchange.[l] That means the role of bringing out the ransom tomorrow has fallen onto Tsubaki's shoulders.
“Well then, I'll see you tomorrow. I'm really looking forward to it.”
“Ah...!”
　Just when she was about to tell him to wait, she was greeted with the steady tone of a dropped call.
　Extreme fatigue attacked her.[l] Haru looked at Tsubaki's face with probing eyes.
“Are you alright?”
“...I'm fine, Oharu-chan.”
“What did he say?”
　Tsubaki flipped through her diary and repeated everything to Haru.[l] Haru silently listened to Tsubaki's doddering explanation.
“I have a charger right here.”
　Haru passed it over as she spoke.
“This phone was given to me by the culprit in the first place.”
“Have you always been carrying it?”
“This is the only lead I have. I've kept it charged so that he can call me at any time. And apparently, ‘Maou’ predicted as much.”
　Tsubaki tilted her head and asked a question.
“‘Maou’?”
“Yes, ‘Maou’.”
“This ‘Maou’ person is the kidnapper?”
“Yeah...”
　Haru nodded.
“Do you know him?”
　Haru hesitated for a moment at Tsubaki's question.
“I can't say that I know him personally... but Tsubaki, don't you recognize his voice?”
“Huh? Voice?”
“The kidnapper's voice.”
　Tsubaki reflected one more time.[l] The kidnapper's baritone was full of allure, full of confidence.
“N-no, I don't think so...”
“You haven't heard it somewhere else before?”
“Grilling me on it won't...”
　She rarely hears the voices of men.[l] The only impressionable one belongs to Azai Kyousuke.[l] When Kyousuke talks on the phone, he sometimes uses an oppressively cold tone, a tone which frightens her into a cold sweat.
　Almost unable to stop herself from saying Kyousuke's name, Tsubaki started to panic.
　――Azai-kun can't be the kidnapper.
　A wave of embarrassment suddenly assailed her.[l] If Kyousuke hadn't helped, her family might not even have the ransom right now.[l] And he even talked to them about the land.[l] Kyousuke might come off like a lazy playboy, but he's actually a gentle, reliable person.
　As that thought sprang to Tsubaki's mind, it was accompanied by an image of Kyousuke's face as he's passionately going off about classical music.
　A fire burned in her chest.
“Forget it. By the way, I want to help out tomorrow.”
“Huh?”
　Tsubaki, trapped in a dream, was suddenly pulled back to reality.
“I'm going to catch the criminal.”
　Haru stated her resolution.
　Tsubaki's father, who had been silent up until now, took that as a cue to speak.
“You're going to catch him?”
　The man stood up with great effort.
“That means... he won't get the money, right?”
“I'll try to ensure that he doesn't.”
　Hearing this, Tsubaki became flustered.
“No! If we don't give him the money, Hiroaki will...!”
　The kidnapper promised.[l] If they follow his orders, he'll release Hiroaki.[l] Just as Tsubaki was going to question Haru, her father held out a hand to stop her.
“Tsubaki, calm down.”
“But...”
　Haru lowered her head slightly.
“I scared you. Sorry, Tsubaki.”
“Ah, no, it's my fault. I just got confused, and...”
　Haru gave Tsubaki a reassuring smile.
“Your name is Usami-san, correct?”
“You can call me Haru if you like, Sir.”
“You say that you'll catch him, all by yourself?”
“Yes... I think the most desirable outcome is one where the money is retained while Hiroaki is returned safely.”
“Of course, if we catch the culprit, everything will be solved. Still, we've already decided not to call the police.”
“Are you implying that we should follow the kidnapper's instructions?”
　Haru looked as though she disapproved of the thought.
“The criminal is not a person to be underestimated. He has the brutality to kidnap a child and send the family his hair, and the brains to come up with original ideas such as asking for the ransom in stocks.”
　What is Haru trying to say?[l] Tsubaki wasn't able to concern herself with the criminal's personality.[l] In her mind, simply the act of kidnapping alone made him nothing but an object of fear.
“Well, with such a ferocious opponent, how are you going to catch him?”
　Tsubaki's father was right.
“No matter how smart he is, there's still a single moment where he will absolutely have to show himself.”
“And that moment is?”
“The moment he intends to retrieve the ransom. Even if no one knows of his true identity, he has to show up when he's taking the certificates from Tsubaki's hands.”
　Indeed, the criminal has even said that he wants to meet Tsubaki.[l] She may actually end up coming face to face with him.
　Tsubaki's father shook his head.
“Usami-san, like you said before, even if we give him the ransom, we can't guarantee Hiroaki's safety...”
“Yes. In all honesty, I don't believe Hiroaki-kun will be coming back even if the kidnapper receives the ransom.”
“Why? That's not what he promised, is it?”
　Tsubaki interrupted, and Haru stared at her.
“To a kidnapper, the hostage is a dangerous bomb just waiting to explode. After the hostage is released, he might remember the kidnapper's voice and appearance, and might even be able to tell the police where he was imprisoned.”
“...Azai-kun, Usami-san... Tsubaki's friends are no ordinary people.”
　Her father smiled weakly.[l] A ferocious battle is waging in his chest.[l] If the police aren't called, and the criminal's orders are followed, it would mean losing the land that he's protected up until now.[l] This is the first time that Tsubaki has seen her father in so much pain.
“To tell you the truth, I'm completely lost. I want to grab the phone and call the police right now. But the moment I remember that this action might cause me to lose Hiroaki, I become paralyzed by terror.”
“I understand your feelings...”
“Tsubaki, are you against Usami-san's idea?”
　Facing her father's inquiry, Tsubaki hesitated on her reply.
　A feeling similar to guilt began to sprout within her.[l] Rather than her friend, Haru, she chose to follow the instructions of this cruel, faceless criminal.
“Haru-chan...”
　Haru averted her eyes.
“I don't have the right to say anything about other people's family matters. Please excuse my input. I'm very sorry.”
　Tsubaki felt pricks of pain probe her chest.[l] The girl who calls herself a hero was only proposing to the others what she felt was the best course of action.[l] Tsubaki wanted to at least take her feelings into consideration.
　After much agonizing deliberation, Tsubaki finally spoke up.
“I'm sorry, Dad. I'm really scared to call the police. I heard the kidnapper's voice, and I think he's a really scary person. I think that we definitely can't call the police.”
　He nodded deeply.
“Still, I think that what Haru-chan just said is logical. I want to catch the criminal.”
“Tsubaki...”
“So, Haru-chan... I won't stop you from doing whatever it is you want to do.”
　Tsubaki's smile was answered with Haru's.
“Thank you.”
“No problem. Isn't Madame Hero the only one who can defeat ‘Maou’?”
　Her father also gave a satisfied smile.
“Are you going to be alright tomorrow, Tsubaki? I'm really worried about you. I'd swap with you if I could...”
“It's fine, Dad. Thank you.”
　Tsubaki's father relied on her.[l] She realized recently that, as the eldest child, she's always been the family's center.
“Alright, then. Call in the kids, and we'll eat.”
“It would be a great help to my food expenses if you would allow me to join you...”
“Of course. We'll all eat together.”
“Sorry for the imprudent request...”
　The night grew deeper.
　Even from within the dark, wintry abyss that had been thrust upon this family, a single flower finally bloomed.
...
......
Turns out that what Tsubaki's father wanted to talk to me about wasn't anything important.
It was probably just Tsubaki's excuse to call me out.
It doesn't bother me or anything though.
It's relatively normal for a girl to use this kind of tactic.
Tsubaki, who was dressing up in front of the mirror, probably didn't even have a single thought of deceiving me.
This is the way it should be.
“Tsubaki, where did you get that outfit?”
“Online. You know, you can buy anything through the internet these days, and they usually even have next day delivery. It's so convenient.”
“You didn't know about this before?”
“Yeah, because I had no interest before. I feel like I've been missing out.”
Her expression might be bright, but I get the feeling that it looked a bit haggard as well.
“Have you written in your diary lately?”
“Nope, not at all. I don't have time for that.”
Her eyes were dull, and seemed just a bit empty.
“Haah, geez, I should give up on that. Nobody writes in a diary for fun nowadays. What do you think?”
“Is that really how you feel? Personally, when someone says Tsubaki, I immediately jump to that diary of yours.”
“...Hmm.”
Tsubaki wrinkled her eyebrows.
“Hey, Sis.”
“Hmm? What is it, Hiroaki?”
“Let's go play hide-and-seek.”
“Maybe later. Hey, do you think this looks nice?”
Tsubaki held out her new clothes for her brother to see.
“Nope.”
“...Huh?”
...Kids sure are frank.
“What's wrong with the clothes that I said were pretty before?”
“That coat with the hood? Aren't I always wearing that old thing?”
“Yup. My friends even started calling you ‘poor devil’. But... didn't you say you liked it?”
“......”
“Is somethin' wrong, Onee-chan?”
“Azai-kun, what do you think?”
Tsubaki looked at me with pleading eyes.
“Eh. If I had to choose between one and the other, I'd say the new clothes are a bit more fitting.”
“Really? They are, aren't they?”
“There's a different air to them. That's a good thing, right?”
Tsubaki was so happy that her voice was shaking.
“I'm so glad you like them! After all, I'm dressing like this so that I won't embarrass you, Azai-kun.”
“You don't have to worry about that...”
“Don't be silly. Aren't you always wearing really expensive clothes? Isn't it embarrassing to be seen walking beside me?”
“Now why would you think that?”
I tilted my head, trying to read Tsubaki's feelings.
“Huh? Is it strange to worry about things like that?”
“No, not at all. It's very normal.”
“That's a relief. I think I've been sort of tired lately, you know? I've started blabbing out what I'm thinking. If I do anything strange, you have to tell me.”
I nodded silently.
“Hey, Sis.”
The ankle-biter was spinning around Tsubaki's knees as usual.
“Find Dad, he'll play with you.”
“But Dad's busy with moving.”
Her father has been packing since morning, apparently.
“Sis and Azai-kun are going to leave soon...!”
Tsubaki raised her voice.
“Where are you going? I want to go too.”
“No way... geez!”
Tsubaki violently cast aside her brother's hand.
“Ah...”
“......”
For an instant, Hiroaki's expression was shocked to the point of fear.
“L-let's go, Azai-kun!”
Not even giving her brother a second glance, Tsubaki hastily made for the door.
I just followed her.
“Haa... haa...”
Tsubaki was gasping for air with huge gulps. She didn't exactly seem to be in good condition to be going out.
“Ah, I meant to change into something else.”
She touched the coat that she usually wears with a dissatisfied look.
My excitement for our upcoming excursion dashed, I gazed over at Tsubaki.
“Is it okay for you to skip out on packing today? Your dad looks like he's working too hard.”
“...It's fine. I've been doing pretty much everything recently.”
“Still, I can't believe you're finally moving...”
I did a lazy stretch and looked at the house's ancient exterior.
“Haven't you lived here all your life?”
“So what...?”
Uneasy, she answered with a question.
“Nothing, I was just thinking that you might miss some things about this place...”
“Yeah, some things...”
Her words were unclear, and her line of sight flitted about.
Her dazed eyes settled on the front lawn.
“What is it?”
“Nothing... I was just remembering all the times we played with sparklers out here in the yard...”
“Ah.”
“We used to roast sweet potatoes in the fall. One time, Dad went a bit overboard and almost burned the house down.”
“When the youngest child was a baby, their first crawl sent them right off the porch. Everyone was running around in circles panicking...”
“And then...”
“......”
Her brilliant smile was starting to wither.
“Hey, Tsubaki...”
I slowly, gently put my hand on Tsubaki's shoulder.
“You can make just as many wonderful memories at your new home, you know.”
“I saw the place, it's pretty nice. And it's close to my house, too. Maybe you can invite me to your next family gathering.”
“I've never spent much time with my family, and I have to admit that some nights I wish I could have some warm, hearty home cooking.”
“...Azai-kun.”
Tsubaki brought her hand to her shoulder and placed her fingers atop mine.
“First the kidnapping, and now the move... It feels like you've had nothing but tragedy recently. I know that you've been under an increasing amount of stress each day, but it'll get easier from here on out. Just stay positive and focus on what's ahead of you.”
“When you say it, Azai-kun... it makes me feel a bit more upbeat about things.”
Redness floated to Tsubaki's face, almost like she had a fever.
“Well then, let's go.”
“...Um, ah, wait...”
Suddenly, Tsubaki tilted her head.
“Azai-kun...”
“Hmm?”
“Never mind. I just thought that you seemed different from usual when you say things like that.”
“You're right, I'm different when I'm at school.”
“Ah, that's not what I meant...”
“How should I say this...?”
Unexpectedly, she flashed a smile.
“I think you sound like the kidnapper sometimes. Sorry, I realize that's bizarre.”
I laughed along with her.
“You think I'm ‘Maou’ too? Don't go joining Usami's ranks, now.”
“Oh? Haru-chan suspected you at one point? That's too much. There's no way you could possibly be the culprit.”
“Yeah, Usami really gives me a headache.”
“You shouldn't worry about it. I believe you, Azai-kun. If it wasn't for you, there's a chance that Hiroaki wouldn't be with us now.”
“I didn't do anything all that incredible. Anyway, it's time that we get going.”
“Right, it's too cold to be standing around.”
With matching smiles, we left Tsubaki's home.
“Are you happy with it?”
“Yeah, this is the first time I've ever bought makeup.”
“Now you're one step closer to the other girls in our class.”
“Yeah, everyone's using it.”
“Don't get me wrong, I'm not one for heavy makeup either, but I would have at least expected you to cover up the dark circles under your eyes.”
“Sorry, I'm just not very familiar with these things.”
We walked away from the crowd.
“Ah, sorry, phone.”
Tsubaki's newly bought cell gets a call pretty often.
“...Yeah... how'm I supposed to know...? Sure...”
Covering her mouth with her hands and speaking in a low voice, Tsubaki seems very unhappy.
“What's up?”
“It was another call from home. They want to know where Mom's handbag is. How the heck am I supposed to know these things...?”
“Yeesh, they can't do a thing without me...”
“Are you going home?”
“Nah, I'm okay.”
Tsubaki shook her head immediately.
“Oh? Is that you, Azai-san?”
Hearing Usami's voice approach from behind, I turned around.
“Ohhh? Tsubaki's here too. Would you look at that...”
“What is it, Haru-chan?”
“Why am I bumping into you so much? Are you stalking me?”
“Not to the extent that the two of you have to team up and interrogate me. My shift just ended, so I'm on my way to the station.”
“The station? Are you going somewhere?”
“Nah. I was thinking I might come across some evidence.”
“Evidence?”
This girl sure knows how to pique my interest, whether she knows she's doing it or not.
“Ah, no. This isn't something I should say on your date.”
“Azai-kun, shall we go?”
“Just a minute. Usami, have you figured out who the kidnapper is?”
“Not in the slightest.”
She stated that without changing her expression in the least.
“Didn't you say that you had something to tell me yesterday?”
“Huh? I said that?”
“...You...”
“Ah, looks like I had a slip of the tongue.”
“Just come out and say it already.”
Usami spoke casually, with a perfect poker face.
“Alright, fine. You're ‘Maou’, Azai-san.”
She actually said it.
Her words were utterly insane.
The right side of my face stiffened.
“You made a duplicate of the coin locker key beforehand.”
“...What did you say?”
“There was a time during the ransom's exchange where the briefcase was put into an automatic coin locker. During that period, I asked you to stay there and keep an eye out for suspicious people, did I not?”
“Ah... right. Wasn't Tsubaki running around the streets with the key?”
Usami nodded and continued.
“You used your copy of the key to waltz right in there and take the ransom.”
“Stop joking around. Copy the key? Me? When?”
“Didn't you say you had something urgent to do that day? If you wanted to copy the key, you could have done it in half an hour at a nearby locksmith.”
“I have no memory of doing that.”
“You really hit me in a blind spot there. The trick itself was simple, yes, but I never would have thought that the kidnapper was someone I trusted so thoroughly.”
I could say nothing against that.
Even though I'm definitely not the culprit, I couldn't think of anything at the moment to check Usami's logic.
“Haru-chan, that's enough. Don't you realize this has nothing to do with you?”
Looks like Tsubaki is still on my side.
“I don't like this, Haru-chan. I know you were only helping us out, but in the end, nothing was solved.”
“......”
Usami's poker face still stood strong.
“Why do you have to bring this up now? I'm out having fun so I can forget about that stuff...”
“Exactly. Let's get out of here.”
I urged Tsubaki while shaking my head slightly.
I'm feeling dizzy.
“Hey, Usami. I'll forget about what you said just now.”
“Really? I appreciate it. Still, I have one last thing to say.”
“Haru-chan!”
“If what I said makes sense, please give yourself up immediately. The police will find the evidence. They'll also comb through the list of nearby locksmiths and watch the security videos from the station.”
“Those police you mentioned, have they even made a move yet?”
“No. I can barely contain my chagrin.”
“Then there's nothing to discuss here.”
I took Tsubaki's hand.
“......”
“Bye, Haru-chan.”
Usami nodded slightly and left.
“Don't mind her, Azai-kun...”
“Ah...”
...Usami hasn't given it up yet?
Still, as long as the police aren't informed, everything will be fine...
...Hmm?
What, exactly, will be fine?
I pondered this thought deeply.
...Nah, I'm overthinking things. I just don't want the police to find out about the connections between the Azai Corporation and the Souwa Alliance.
I can't possibly be ‘Maou’.
Actually, that reminds me. I haven't gone to Dr. Akimoto's clinic lately.
“What is it? Don't worry about it, Azai-kun. Even if you were ‘Maou’, I wouldn't mind.”
That was probably a joke, but I can't bring myself to laugh.
“Say, ready to go eat?”
She held out her hand again.
Tsubaki is very obedient to me.
I should shake all this off and just try to enjoy being with her.
“Ah, that was so much fun!”
She held out her arms and stretched lazily.
The Tsubaki from before definitely wouldn't do something like this.
“We were out for an entire day. Are you satisfied?”
“Yeah, and the dinner was delicious.”
“Isn't it wonderful to have money?”
Tsubaki nodded grandly.
“I'm learning so much about the world. I was never interested in these things before, but it looks like money really is important.”
“Depending on how you use it, money can buy you anything.”
“Anything? Like what?”
“Like your heart...”
I said this half-joking.
“W-what? Oh come on. You don't need money for that, do you?”
“Ah, sorry, that was just a bad joke. I guess I have a reputation for putting my foot in my mouth.”
We laughed and chatted in the empty park for quite some time.
It was kind of fun.
If I were a normal human, and we continued to do stuff like this, I might actually fall in love with Tsubaki.
But beyond the fun, there's an air of sadness hanging around us.
I'm always reluctant to part with her for some reason.
“Hey, Azai-kun, what are you up to tomorrow?”
“Oh, are you inviting me again?”
“Yeah, is there something wrong with that?”
...I'm busy tomorrow.
“You help your father with work, right? Is it tough? What kind of tasks does he have you do?”
Tsubaki assailed me with nonstop questions.
“Are you interested?”
“Totally.”
I thought it over for a while.
Like any business, my work could be facilitated by various things.
One of those is a secretary... though I guess that makes me sound a bit self-important. I just want an assistant or something.
I could use someone to help with some small odd jobs such as organizing my files, or dealing with the bills and email.
It can't be someone from the Azai Corporation.
Even if they're capable, they won't obey me.
The loyalty they've sworn is to Gonzou, not me.
In the near future, I'll need my own organization.
From that perspective, Tsubaki is a perfect start.
Women are generally kept on the down-low in the underground, but they still have their uses.
“Do you want to try and work with me a little tomorrow?”
“Huh? What do you mean?”
“I want you to help me for a bit.”
A confused look surfaced on Tsubaki's face.
“C-can a person like me really be of any use?”
“Definitely, don't worry about it. You're an honest, hard worker. You'll be fine.”
“Really? I'm so happy. But... this is so unexpected.”
Her breaths, coming out in excited gasps, were dyed white by the cold.
“Of course, you can't tell anyone.”
Tsubaki's eyes shone with excitement, earnestly listening to my every word.
“I won't tell a soul. I promise.”
“Then I'll contact you tomorrow.”
“I'll definitely be waiting for your call.”
“You definitely better.”
Tsubaki's expression tightened when I emphasized my expectations.
“I'm going to take a day off from school tomorrow, but you'll still be attending. Can you take calls when classes are in session?”
“Huh?”
She seems to be uneasy.
“You know how I'm often absent from school? Sometimes I get splitting headaches and have to stay in bed, but most of the time it's because of the company.”
“Company...? Are you talking about your job...?”
“Do you understand? To me, school is a place of relaxation. I lied when I said that I was just helping out my father. The truth is, the company is my main occupation.”
“I knew you were an amazing person and all, but I didn't know that... so that's how it is...”
“So, if a call comes, be sure to take it immediately. That's how the business world works.”
I stepped closer to her.
“Can you promise me this much?”
Tsubaki held her breath.
“Th-this isn't something bad, is it?”
“Of course not. It's not like we're doing anything illegal. There's nothing to worry about.”
Sometimes we'll step into a gray area bordering on criminal activity, but she doesn't need to know that right now.
“...Erm...”
Hesitation.
But since we've made it this far, I can't let her escape.
“This is the first time I've told anyone about this. You're the first to know, Tsubaki.”
I started with a small voice, and slowly.
“I'm only a kid, after all. No one would believe that I'm doing an adult's job, and no one understands how hard it is for me.”
I slowly accelerated, and inserted emotion.
“But you're different, Tsubaki. Fate, acting through that kidnapping tragedy, has allowed us to understand each other so well. We have such a good relationship, and... well...”
I increased my volume.
“These past few days have been so amazing. To be honest, I've never trusted anyone, but for some reason it's so easy to tell you the truth. You're the only one I can tell my secrets, Tsubaki.”
I made sure to keep saying her name.
“......”
Tsubaki's eyes were wide open as breath after breath rushed from her lips.
“I didn't know you thought of me that way...”
“Alright... I understand... I'll skip school tomorrow and wait for your call...”
...That's a good girl.
The work isn't particularly pressing; the issue is whether or not she can properly follow my directions.
“Well then, see you tomorrow.”
“Yeah, good night...”
We waved goodbye.
I turned my head around, only to see that Tsubaki was still frozen in place.
And then, a small shadow appeared.
“Onee-chan...!”
It was her brother.
“Hiroaki, what are you doing...!?”
“I'm here to walk you home, Sis.”
I watched their conversation from afar.
“...Don't tell me... by yourself again?”
“Mm-mm. Dad's going to be here soon.”
“Why didn't you wait for him!?”
Tsubaki screamed again, this time with all her strength.
“Didn't your Sis tell you already? Don't walk around by yourself!”
“Sorry, but you said that you'd be back, and it's so late, and you still weren't home, so...”
Tsubaki must have told her family when she'd be back during one of her frequent phone calls.
“But, didn't I say it over and over again?”
Tsubaki stooped down, continuing to talk with her brother.
“......”
It must be really difficult to take care of that boy.
It's not like I don't understand how Tsubaki feels.
“Why won't you stop this already!?”
“Whaddya mean?”
On a rural evening, sound travels far, and I can hear even very small voices.
“I'm worried about you! What if something happens again? Why don't you get it!?”
“It's fine! I'm okay! I can go to kindergarten by myself! I can come walk you home!”
“...Egh...”
Tsubaki's quiet voice is echoing around.
...It's not good to eavesdrop. I should get going.
It's not like I don't care, but I can't do anything about others' family affairs.
As I left, I heard Tsubaki say something.
“Really...? Then I won't worry about you anymore...”
That line brought with it the darkest and most depressed tone I had heard yet from Tsubaki.
“For cryin' out loud, every last one of you assholes is useless!”
“I'm very sorry.”
“Yeah, we're real sorry.”
Eiichi put on airs of importance the next afternoon.
“Just when did you plan on introducing me to a girl, Usami-san? Huh?”
“Eh, in a couple of days.”
“Now that you've seen what I'm really like, I'm quite the prick, ain't I!? I'm at the age where I just want to penetrate something! I can't wait anymore!”
It's only been two days, and he's already impatient as hell.
“Alright, tell you what, I'll help you find your dream girl.”
“Just... please calm down for now.”
This joker's mood is just a disaster today...
“What's got you all riled up this time?”
“I actually ate dinner with my dad yesterday. It's been a long time, okay?”
“You have a dad?”
“What? Didn't you grow up in an orphanage?”
“That was all a lie. My dad's a hotelier.”
“Seriously?”
“The Central District's Plaza Hotel, Grand Hotel, and Top Of Tomanbetsu are all under Dad's control.”
“You're shitting me.”
“If you think I'm lying, then how about I give you a free night?”
“......”
“......”
I glanced at Usami.
“It seems legit.”
“Hmph.”
I didn't know at all.
I have heard of a hotel owner named Aizawa before.
But who would ever believe that he was actually Eiichi's father?
“Wait a second... so for all that calling me rich and pampered, you grew up in a wealthy household too?”
“I'm different from you. Dad's really strict about everything. He even told me I couldn't keep insects as pets. Isn't that just nuts?”
“I see...”
“Plus, Dad got home at two last night. What do you think he was doing? And as soon as he shows up, he starts talking about his job.”
“Was it about the Plaza Hotel?”
“Yeah, they say a guest disappeared. He registered and all, but the phone number he gave didn't work and the address was a phony. They wanted to call the police, but then they found the room key and the payment under the bed.”
“You didn't call the police, did you? There was nothing stolen or anything, after all.”
“They didn't, but PHEW, Dad would've done more than bitch about it if they had. He kept on sayin', ‘If word about something like this came out, then our reputation would be ruined and customers wouldn't come anymore. I'm the owner of the place, so they should stop crying to me each and every time some piddly crap like this comes up.’”
“I mean, TELL ME ABOUT IT, right? I'm just your son, so stop crying to me about this crap. What are you trying to do, make me turn to delinquency here?”
“Oh, come on. Your father's a good person. You should take a lesson from him.”
“Keh, you mere mortals can't possibly understand my worries.”
Eiichi just kept on sulking. Nothing would stop him now.
“So that means we were completely played.”
“And after all the trouble we've been through...”
After class was over, Usami and I held a strategy meeting.
“About that Saijou...”
“Yeah?”
“I asked Gonzou about his so-called Great Japan Revolutionary School. He said he'd never heard of it.”
“Is it because it's small enough to fly under the radar?”
“Who knows? Those organizations are a dime a dozen.”
“Then it'll be difficult to track Saijou through that route.”
“Yeah. In the meantime, Horibe and his crew are combing through the inner city's hotels.”
And not just hotels, but subway stations, under bridges, and any other places a person might be staying. They're even checking vacant office buildings.
“But couldn't Saijou have escaped to another prefecture by now?”
“Yeah, I hear you. The creep's probably scared to death of the power of the Souwa Alliance by now. Seeing as how that might be the case, Gonzou issued orders last night and sent over a hundred people out of the prefecture.”
To cooperate with the local gangs, and collect information about ‘Maou’ and Saijou.
When you tack on the upcoming battle with the Shin'ei Group, the Sonoyama Group has its hands full.
“...If there's anything I can do...”
“Isn't waiting for news the only thing to do?”
To be more precise, since we failed last time, we can't make rash movements anymore.
“Let's go back to the drawing board.”
“Hmm?”
“Kanon was awarded the NHK Trophy. Because this went against ‘Maou's’ orders, her mother, Ikuko-san, is in mortal danger.”
“That's why we're searching for Saijou in the first place.”
“That's true...”
She's being kind of vague about this...
“Saijou's a chess piece ‘Maou’ prepared for this match. The use of an accomplice represents a potential risk, but also a corresponding return to go along with that risk.”
“Thus, the method he'll use to take Ikuko's life is one that relies on the existence of said accomplice, correct?”
“We have to work under that assumption. If ‘Maou’ could do it himself all along, there'd be no need to recruit someone else. Therefore, Saijou must still be within the city, isn't that right?”
“Yeah, I suppose chasing Saijou is still the best course of action. If we catch Saijou, it's possible that we can disrupt ‘Maou's’ plans.”
I sneered.
“What's wrong? Getting depressed already?”
“No way, that could never happen. The only times I've ever gotten depressed were when I lost my wallet and when I found out that penguins mated.”
...This girl's got a screw loose.
“I want to go back to Saijou's apartment one more time and look for clues.”
“Alright. Don't do anything rash.”
“Understood. I am one of the victim candidates, after all.”
After her statement, Usami prepared to head home.
......
...
　The happy sound of children's laughter weaved into the surroundings.
　‘Mephistopheles’――Saijou――was sitting on a bench in the Eastern District's park, waiting for ‘Maou’ to contact him.
　The elementary school students, ignoring the brisk wind, fought to get to the sandbox and the slide.
　Saijou thought of his own sister.[l] And of the detective who was in charge of the investigation.[l] Saijou had choked her to death.[l] That sister, who had just started school, whom he loved so much.[l] That angelic, smiling face, which unbeknownst to him, suddenly had eyeballs bugging out of their sockets.[l] You killed her...
　No.
　...That's right... she didn't die.
　His sister loved him.[l] They would hold hands and go to school together.[l] When bathing, she'd scrub him from top to bottom.[l] She never forgot to give him a good night's kiss.[l] In other words, she must have loved him deeply.
　What was wrong with what he did?[l] Flowers are meant to be picked when they're the most beautiful.[l] Saijou hadn't killed her, he just made her his.[l] It's just that those annoying police exaggerated the matter and forced punishment upon him.[l] He spent those long, hard years, the years before he became a legal adult, in that building with the high fences.
　‘Maou's’ call came.
“...Are you alright?”
“They won't chase me to a faraway park like this.”
“Please don't underestimate those people.”
“I won't. But until the last three people are killed, I won't leave this city.”
　Yoshida Kimiko, the woman he had failed to kill earlier,[l] Kanesaki Ikuko, the figure skating coach,[l] and the girl named Usami Haru...
　His heart was aquiver with anticipation for the murderous plans that would be presented to him in the future.
“I'm at the arena now.”
　One could almost hear the ecstasy drip from ‘Maou's’ words.
“The Finals will commence tomorrow. It's a large-scale competition with contestants from six different countries, and represents the closing act of the Grand Prix. The event will be quite extravagant, I suspect.”
　...Saijou wanted to ask, ‘Just what the hell are you talking about?’[l] However, not wanting to risk hindering their relationship, he stopped himself.
“Of course, all it really boils down to is a competition about money. It's just a show run by the International Skating Union to help fill their pockets. It's even become common practice for last season's world champion to abstain from the competition, out of fear of losing their popularity and honor.”
　Saijou could only mumble some vague confirmations in response.
“Even the new evaluation methods are making the sport more boring. Now I must admit, the new scoring system has achieved its intended effects of preventing cheating, but it's just slaughtered the new routines. Under the new rules, the number of jumps is the deciding factor for score. The graceful transitions, one after another, are now unnecessary. Anyone can see the results of the change. Pretty much each and every contestant goes out and does the same program. And since they fear the judge's penalties, they're avoiding any big challenges. You can't even see any spectacular falls anymore. Just how is this a ‘free skate’...?”
　Unbelievably, ‘Maou’ sighed.[l] This made Saijou a bit insecure.
“For instance, I think that Seta Makiko is better than Azai Kanon. The basis behind this thought is her set of fundamentals. Her movements, perfectly synchronized with the musical accompaniment, are very beautiful. And I happen to know that she overcame many hardships and gave an unrivaled amount of effort. Yet a single jump with a large amount of rotations is enough to completely upset the rankings. In the end, the victory goes to those who have the flashiest trump card. What a terrible age we've entered...”
　Saijou finally understood his comrade's grievances.[l] Thinking about things clearly, each target up until now has had something to do with figure skating.
“Ah, I'm sorry. I got a little carried away.”
“‘Maou’, let me ask you something.”
　His suspicion slipped out of his mouth.
“Aren't you a part of the revolution? Aren't you worried about our country?”
“......”
“Why do you have such a focus on figure skating?”
　The mysteries just kept piling up.[l] The targets were scum, but still only normal civilians.[l] Why didn't the names of greater evils such as government leaders and the masterminds behind religious organizations appear on the list?
　As he pondered this point, he let up a bit.
“I'm sorry for bringing this up now. Maybe it's just something that only someone as sharp as you could understand.”
　Saijou didn't want to be hated by the only person to understand him in decades.[l] And ‘Maou’ had helped him get out of trouble just yesterday.
“You're spot on.”
“What do you mean?”
“I merely took issue with the current state of figure skating. I wanted to wipe the people who were only in it for money off the face of the earth.”
“......”
“And because of that, I used you.”
　‘Maou’ spoke... bitterly.
　Incredibly, flames of anger didn't roar within Saijou's chest.[l] The emotions of an event long-forgotten floated to his heart once again.[l] He remembered a time when his sister broke a toy that he treasured.[l] He remembered his sister coming to him with an honest apology.
“Thank you for your help up until now.”
　Saijou's hand trembled, shaking the phone it held.
“At the moment, it would appear the best plan is to escape to western Japan. Though you could take a bullet train, taking a night bus or ferry would be safer. Please contact me after you get to Fukuoka. I'll prepare a boat for you to take to Taiwan. Just tell me your account number, and the money for the escape will be wired...”
“Wait, ‘Maou’.”
　Words burst from his mouth.
“I never said I wanted to escape.”
“But...”
“No, I'm going to finish this.”
“But why?”
　Saijou made his decision, and sighed.
“I have also been deceiving you. The Great Japan Revolutionary School doesn't exist. No, you could say that it exists, but the representatives, public relations department, operations planning; the whole group is one person... me.”
“What...?”
“This world thought of me as a deviant. But you supported me, and sent me that powerful, emotional message. You called a powerless person such as me a hero.”
　There would be no more hesitation.[l] No matter what ‘Maou's’ true goal was, he would still be Saijou's friend.
“Tell me. The person you really want to kill isn't among those three, is it? Your real target is――”
　Saijou said a name.
　‘Maou’ gave a short answer... ‘Yes.’
“I'll help you. Come, give me instructions...”
　He didn't know when, but the sounds of the children playing in the park had completely disappeared.
......
...
“Hiya!”
“Really? Your common courtesy's out the window already?”
After dinner, Usami suddenly popped in.
“Your place is so warm, man.”
“Don't curl up on the sofa. Get up.”
Usami rolled around on my couch in her uniform. After a while, she stood up.
“At any rate, it sure is hard to get information about a social recluse.”
“Any leads?”
Usami shook her head wryly.
“I found a phone bill. Upon examination, it looks like he pays about the same as me, almost nothing.”
“That means, like you, he has no friends.”
“It looks like he only works at places that pay by the day, seeing as how he has his own safety helmets and military gloves. He also seems to be registered at an employment agency, there were a few pay stubs.”
“...So he lived a life without a steady job...”
“He actually seems to be rather earnest. I didn't even find a sex-service membership or any horse-racing tickets. There are signs that he cooked for himself. We even found a clothes iron and pants press.”
“I guess that just goes to show you that sometimes it's the people like that who can be the most dangerous...”
“There was only one thing that could be called a lead...”
Just then, a sound rang out from the front door.
“I'm back～!”
I had given Kanon a spare key to the room.
“Hiya!”
“Hiya!”
What is wrong with these two...?
“Hey, Usamin, you're here. The place is a bit dirty, but go ahead and sit wherever you like.”
“This is MY place.”
“Oh, as rare as it is that we have a get-together like this, I have to go home now.”
“Oh? Hey...”
She just said something about a lead...
“Why? Let's hang out～!”
For some reason, Usami kept glancing at my bed.
“Bye...”
In a hurry, with her back slumped, she left.
“Hey, hey, why did Usamin come over?”
“Who knows... to get out of the cold, maybe?”
“Now that you mention it, isn't she freezin' her butt off in those clothes?”
A reasonable question, Kanon.
“Probably. Let's just chalk it up to her strange nature.”
“Hmm?”
“W-what are you looking at? Why is your face so close to mine?”
I could see myself reflected in her eyes.
“You two have a secret, don't you?”
“Wha-?”
“The sofa's messy. What did you do?”
“We didn't do anything, okay...? Wait, that's...”
There was a cell phone on the sofa. I think it's Usami's.
“It must have fallen out when she was rolling around...”
“She even rolled around?”
“By herself, yes.”
Oh well, I'll give it to her at school tomorrow.
“Hmm, she's definitely up to something. I haven't seen Papa lately, either. Something must be going on around Non-chan～... yeah, that's totally it.”
“Papa's just busy with his end-of-year responsibilities.”
“Then what about all the people who're hanging around Coach? They look like they were sent there by Papa. People are up to something, I tell ya.”
“Hm, is that so...?”
I knew she'd notice.
“It's like Coach's being protected, you know? They're even there when she goes to the bathroom.”
I don't think a lie would work here.
“Why are they protecting Coach? If it was Mr. Hilton or some important person from the skating union, then I'd understand... what do you think, Nii-san?”
“I don't know... stop talking and go take your bath.”
“What, even Nii-san's in on it? You can't scare Non-chan!”
“Don't worry about it. Didn't you say you had no interest in anything besides skating?”
“Oh, yeah. Sometimes you say some pretty good things, Nii-san.”
Her smile was immediately restored.
“The Finals start tomorrow, right?”
“Yeah, the ladies' starts a couple days later, though.”
“Alright, then hurry up and take a bath.”
“Can do!”
She skipped over to the changing room.
“......”
If she wasn't able to change moods that quickly, there's a chance she wouldn't be as famous as she is now.
Just a single performance from her can have a major influence on a number of people.
Whether or not a jump is successful will change the number of spectators and the mood of the sponsors.
And this time her performance is even related to a death threat.
If she worried about every little thing, then she wouldn't be able to do what she does.
Of course, her continuous practice has taken away a normal school life.
And there's no such thing as a person who ignores everything else and just lives to skate.
...Because humans aren't machines.
Behind Kanon's casual smile lies a mountain of bottled-up emotions.
If she found out that her mother's life was in danger...
......
...
