I attended school every day this week, so I feel pretty good.
For me, school is a free place, completely devoid of pressure.
“Hey, Kyousuke.”
Not to mention the countless friends I have.
“So, about what we discussed yesterday, what do you think?”
“Hm?　What about yesterday?”
“Dude, don't fuck around. The thing about your sister.”
...He's still moping over that matter.
“Eiichi, try to be more mature. There'll always be more women.”
“Shut up, Miss Noriko just shot me down in an e-mail. ‘Sorry, but I can't go out with you, Eiichi-kun.’”
“Aww... but wouldn't you say that a woman who turns you down for such a little thing as what happened yesterday isn't the woman you're looking for?”
“Dammit! It's all Kanon's fault!”
Eiichi tightened his small fists to show his indignation.
“What's this about Non-chan?”
“Geh!”
“Ei-chan, what's Non-chan's fault?”
“N-nothing. Ah, Non-chan's always so energetic. I wish I could have some of your vitality.”
He released his clenched hands.
“Kanon, do you have gym class today?”
“Yeah, I can't wait! We all promised to practice in the morning together for the volleyball match tomorrow.”
Kanon lowered the bag that I gave to her as a present.
Inside the bag lies a gym uniform.
“See ya.”
She lightly stepped away.
“Damn, she's annoying. And that stupid smile's the worst part...”
“You aren't exactly the brightest kid, yourself...”
While carrying on with our meaningless conversation, we entered the school.
I arrived quite early today, so there weren't many people in the corridor.
Downstairs, a girl approached us with inhumanly heavy steps.
“Ah, morning...”
“Yo. You're pretty early.”
“Is that so?”
Our eyes never met.
“Oh, Usami-san, Usami-san.”
“Yes?”
“You'll be friends with me today, right? Two people a day, that's what you said, right?”
“No, it's two people per community. Having Tsubaki and Kanon from school has already pushed me to the limit.”
“Meanie...”
“Sorry. I'm not trying to be mean; it's just that I'm rather strict about these matters. I am a hero, after all.”
“But you can at least loosen up a little when you talk to me, right?”
“I'll see you in class.”
I find it hard to interact with this Usami Haru.
“......”
Usami stared at me with discerning eyes.
Such a strange girl.
My entrance to the classroom brought with it a surprise.
The person who had been missing for a few days stood right beside the window.
“Hey, good morning.”
I spoke in a friendly tone.
“You're quite early too, Shiratori-san.”
“......”
Shiratori showed no interest in anyone within the classroom, and continued to water the flowers quietly.
“You're so responsible. You come here early every morning just to water the flowers, don't you?”
My interaction with Shiratori Mizuha is not without purpose.
“Come to think of it, I haven't seen you for quite a while, huh?　I can't really blame you, since I skip every now and then myself... but what made you take a few days off? I hope you didn't catch a cold...”
Shiratori is the daughter of the school's director.
This director is also the chairman of a contracting company.
And that company is a subsidiary of the Sannou Corporation――one of Japan's most prominent and well-established corporations.
The Sannou Corporation, which manufactures everything from pens to rockets, has its headquarters here in Tomanbetsu City. Thus, the variety of businesses it develops here are a huge influence on the region's economy.
Their influence permeates the city so thoroughly that it's practically omnipresent... just like that of the Souwa Alliance.
Which means that if I wanted to operate some financial mechanisms here, keeping a good relationship with Shiratori Mizuha wouldn't hurt one bit.
I put on my fake smile, as usual.
“Hey, Shiratori-san... can I have your number?　Maybe we could hang out sometime.”
Shiratori's hands, and the watering can they held, suddenly halted.
“...Azai-kun.”
“Hm?”
“Do you like flowers?”
“Um, well... I don't really have much of an opinion. I can enjoy the look of a nice garden, but I'm no enthusiast.”
“Then what do you like?”
“Girls.”
I made sure to remember my smile as I spouted that line.
“Just kidding. Classical music. I actually bought a CD just yesterday.”
“Classical music... is that it?”
“Huh? As far as my interests go? The only thing I've got left is going to arcades.”
“Do you like money?”
Although by only the slightest bit, Shiratori's tone changed.
“Money, you say? Hmm... I'm sorta rich and all, so I never really thought about it.”
I smiled as I scratched the back of my head, but then Mizuha suddenly said,
“Too bad...”
As if striking waves on calm waters.
“I was going to reproach you if you answered by saying, ‘I hate money.’”
...Huh? What's up with this woman...?
“Haha... what are you talking about?　Well then, Shiratori-san, do you like money?”
Shiratori didn't answer me.
“I know about you.”
“...What about me?”
“You ride around in an expensive-looking car.”
True, I had an imported deluxe limo.
“I told you I was rich. My dad gave it to me.”
But... why did she know?
“You hang out with some ferocious-looking people.”
“......”
Did she see me on the streets...?
Nobody from this school should know about the Azai Corporation. I have always been careful about how I go about doing things...
“You order people three times your age around like they're slaves.”
“Um, where did you see that...?”
“A residential street in the Southern District. My house is near your foster father's estate.”
“So that's why...”
It's useless to play dumb now.
After all, Shiratori is the director's daughter.
She could've investigated any student's background easily if she wanted to.
“So what?”
I smiled thinly.
“Even knowing that I manage huge capital in the Azai Corporation, what are you going to do?”
“So the real you comes out when you're threatened, hm?”
“Say what you want.”
“Why do you act the part of a lazy student at school?”
“Nobody's going to confess his sins unless he's forced to, isn't that right?”
“Oh, so you know you're doing something wrong?”
“I was just using it as an example. If I were you, I'd stop trying to nitpick and find faults in little things like that. It makes you look bad.”
“Despite your facade, you're actually quite intelligent. I don't think I have any chance of winning.”
Shiratori remains emotionless.
...This is a little troublesome.
The reason I spend my precious time in school is not only to reduce my stress, but also to hide my identity from certain corners of the underworld.
Practically all business is dealt with either by phone or by email. I don't even meet people face to face when the deals go down.
In trades like mine, your life's at risk once you're exposed.
Besides Gonzou, only a few administrators from the group know my identity.
Thus, keeping Shiratori's mouth shut is essential.
“May I ask you to keep this a secret?”
“......”
“Please.”
Shiratori didn't reply.
“I understand. How much do you want?”
“...Ngh.”
Shiratori revealed her emotions for the first time.
“I hate you. That's all I wanted to say.”
“Wait, don't run.”
I grabbed Shiratori's hand.
“How's one million sound?”
“You serious?”
“Money's the only way to gain trust.”
“What a pitiful person.”
“Your sympathy isn't what I need. Just allow me to feel safe.”
I stepped forward.
Shiratori's beautiful lips began to quiver.
“...Everybody's watching us.”
“I'll just say I was hitting on you.”
“Nonsense...”
“Everybody in the class thinks I'm nothing but a playboy.”
Because I intentionally project that aura.
“What about you? You barely ever show up to class. Do you even have any friends? Who do you think's going to side with you?”
“......”
The corners of Shiratori's quivering lips turned down.
“Let's just try to get along, shall we?”
“...Let go of me.”
The class bell rang.
“I hope we can have a more pleasant chat next time, don't you?”
“......”
This time, Shiratori freed herself from my grasp.
She was trying to act tough, but in the end, she's still a teenage girl.
Now, let's enjoy school.
Miki-chan didn't call today.
Tsubaki, Kanon, Eiichi, and I were on the rooftop, as usual. Usami was there as well, keeping her distance from the rest of us.
“Time for lunch～, I'm going to eat a lot today!”
Kanon bought a lot of bread from the convenience store.
“You were very active in gym class again, Kanon-chan. Your stomach's already empty, isn't it?”
“Yeah, and I skipped lunch the past couple days...”
“You have to try my dessert, too! It's a famous pudding from Central Boulevard. I was gonna eat it, but I'll give it to you as a special present.”
...Has he already given up on hating Kanon?
“Oh, pudding from Funky? Looks delicious.”
‘Funky’ is a popular dessert shop among the girls.
“（Haha, it's already expired. Letting you off the hook with a little tummyache, ain't I just a saint?）”
...I really should stop him.
“Non-chan doesn't like pudding.”
“What? Really? You don't like sweets, Kanon-chan?”
“You know what they say. ‘You can't judge a book by its cover.’”
“（Shit, most bitches roll over and spread their legs for a sugary treat. And Jesus Christ, stop acting like you're hot shit by using proverbs.）”
“Aren't you gonna eat any, Ei-chan?”
“No, I'm fine.”
“Why not? I thought you liked sweets. You're always happily digging into them.”
“Hahaha, you know what they say. ‘When you meet someone you have not met for three days, you should see him with a new eye.’”
“That's not a saying.”
“H-how are you not ashamed to be so stupid?”
“Because Non-chan is always right. I'm always right, isn't that so, Nii-san?”
“Yeah. Anyways, eat your pudding, Eiichi.”
“N-no thanks. Tsubaki-chan, would you like it?”
“Sorry, I'm already full.”
“Wh-what about you, Usami-san?”
Usami, who's been watching us argue from far away, responded with another question.
“Pudding can only be stored for three days, right?”
“Yes, though it's better to eat it within two days.”
“So, while I love sweets, I'm going to have to pass on expired goods.”
“Huh?”
Eiichi's pupils contracted.
“Well, it's just a hunch.”
“Um, this might be a little unexpected, but I actually work part-time at a place on Central Boulevard.”
“That's why I know about that place... ‘Funky,’ was it? If I recall correctly, it was closed the day before yesterday. Right?”
“T-two days ago? What's that got to do with anything? I bought this pudding yesterday, what's wrong with that?”
“That seems unlikely.”
“W-why?”
“You eat a different dessert each day, right Etekichi-san? You said something yesterday about... porisi, was it?”
“Not porisi, POLICY!”
“Eh, who cares?”
“Clearly you do, since you're going out of your way to mispronounce it!”
“The point is, you ate pudding yesterday too, didn't you?”
Come to think of it...
“And?”
“If you can't eat the same dessert two days in a row, then buying the same pudding as yesterday with the intent of eating it today doesn't match up with your porisi, does it?”
“N-no, you see... I wanted to give it to Kanon-chan, so I went out of my way to buy it. Yeah, that's it.”
“Didn't you just emphasize that, ‘you were going to eat it?’”
“...That, that was... anyways...”
R.I.P. Aizawa Eiichi.
“That's true. You ate pudding just yesterday, and the shop was closed the day before. Thus, the pudding must be from long ago.”
“Ei-chan... could it be you knew it was expired...?”
“O-of course not! You had no idea, right?”
Everybody stared at Eiichi, approaching him slowly.
“T-the Home Shopping Network, I bought it from the Home Shopping Network!”
...Saying that was like pleading guilty.
“（S-SAVE ME, GOD!）”
“Doubt it's possible, Bro.”
“Kh, kuuuuhhh...”
Eiichi retreated back into his despair.
“B-by the way, Azai-kun, have you listened to the CD yet?”
Tsubaki's trying to change the topic. What a nice person.
Since Eiichi looks miserable, let's just go with the flow.
“Hehe... this CD?　No, I haven't.”
I pulled the Bach CD out of my uniform's pocket.
“Hm?　Why is it still wrapped?　Weren't you looking forward to listening to it?”
“You still don't get it, Tsubaki.”
“It's not a picture of your kid. Why would you put it in your pocket and take it to school?”
“You wouldn't understand either, Kanon.”
I cleared my throat.
looking forward to this magnificent Bach CD. Believe me when I say it's like a glorious treasure that I've been awaiting for far too long.”
“Mh-hm...?”
that is precisely the reason why I will let it sleep, let it ripen a bit in my pocket for one more excruciatingly long day.”
“Oh?”
“I realize it's difficult for you womenfolk to understand this, but the ecstasy of release after forcibly building that gripping tension of unnecessary restraint... it's breathtaking.”
“In other words, you're a masochist.”
“Say what you want. Regardless, I must subject myself to this trial-by-fire today.”
Crap, I'm starting to drool...
“Hee～, let me have a look.”
“Ah...”
She snatched it away from me.
“Hey, HEY! Give it back!”
“Just a little peek, please?”
“...Just, just a peek, okay?　Listen, do not unwrap it. Absolutely DO NOT unwrap it.”
Rrrrrrrip (←The sound tearing plastic makes).
“WAIT, HEY! DAMMIT, I TOLD YOU NOT TO UNWRAP IT!”
“Don't worry, don't worry. I just wanted to take a look at the booklet.”
“DAMN, I wanted to read that too! I've been waiting so long that I would kill just to get a glimpse of it...!”
The scene before me began to twist as if a dimensional rift had opened all around me.[displeasure time=2000]
new! The CD sparkles, too～!”
“S-STOP!　Don't spin that divine disk on your fingers!”
“Heeheehee...”
Kanon flashed a devious smile.
This is bad. That's the same expression she has when she's bullying Eiichi.
“Say, Nii-san...”
Crap...
“Can I snap it?”
“ABSOLUTELY NOT!　ABSOLUTELY NOT!”
“K-Kanon-chan, it's not going to be a joke if you really do snap it, you know?”
“Y-yeah, Tsubaki!　Help me out here!　DON'T BREAK IT!”
“D-don't break it!”
“What should I do～?　Nii-san's getting a headache, Nii-san's getting a headache～”
“......”
“Hey, Usami!　Why are you still standing around!?　Come help us stop her!”
“Oh, okay. Don't break it～...”
“Eiichi, you too! Get up off your lazy ass!　Help me think of a way to stop this crazy kid!”
“Um, 'kay. Don't break it～...”
“Mwahahaha!”
Kanon gripped the CD with both hands.
I clearly saw her thin nails sink into the disk.
“Nii-san, you ditched me two days ago, remember?”
“Oh, yeah...”
“And then you left so suddenly yesterday, too.”
“Stop, STOP...!!!”
“HA!”
“STOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!”
I flew toward Kanon.
...As though a cheetah leaping in for the kill.
She was stunned as I wrestled her for the disk...
Touched the disk with my fingertips...
Got a hold of it for a moment...
...And then lost it again.
I stretched my arms out one last time.
...But the CD had already fallen to the ground.
......
...
The entire landscape darkened in my despair.
I sank to my knees.
Picking up the disk, I examined the surface carefully.
A thread-like scar was gashed across the shimmering surface.
“ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”
Then, there was absolute darkness.
The Bach CD that I've restrained myself from opening has been injured.
“Nii-san, Nii-san.”
Kanon patted my shoulder.
“Ka-... Kanon...”
“Mh～?”
“Don't you have something to say to me?”
She just smiled sweetly like a little devil.
“I didn't mean to break it.”
“...!”
“It's like those big red buttons that say, ‘Do not press;’ when everyone keeps saying, ‘Don't do it’ like a billion times like some comedy sketch, it just makes you want to press it more.”
...This ain't no comedy show!
“She's actually got a point.”
Guh!
“Ch-cheer up, Azai-kun. Don't be so depressed. We can go buy another one sometime...”
Stop shitting around!
“Haha, Kanon-chan really overdid it, but you should try to be more mature about it, Kyousuke.”
You fucker!
“Everybody thinks it's interesting. Nii-san must be really popular.”
...You, you bitch――――!!!
Unforgivable. Absolutely unforgivable!
......
...
...
......
“WE ARE ALIVE!”
“IT IS MINE TO AVENGE!”
“I'D RATHER BETRAY THE WORLD THAN LET THE WORLD BETRAY ME!”
After school, in the lab equipment storage room.
I roared to my worshiper.
“Hey you, foolish mortal!”
“Uh, yes?”
“I shall grant your puny desires.”
“Uh... umm... and what would those be again?”
“Don't go forgetting about it. Kanon, dammit!”
“I, uh... I think you should calm down a bit, Lord.”
“That brat has overstepped her boundaries. Remember when you piddly humans built a tower to Heaven? God was outraged. I feel exactly the same way right now.”
“But, wasn't that just a little sister's prank?”
“There are kinslaying gods!”
“You're... you're serious?”
“Kid, don't you understand?　If you stood in line from 1am to 10am for a game and someone just broke it for fun, what would you do?”
“Um, just go buy a new one?”
“Shut up!　You can only say that when it's not your stuff that's been broken!”
“No, but I mean... didn't God ignore me yesterday?”
“Look, the point is, we have to give Kanon the punishment she deserves.”
“O-okay. What are we going to do?”
“Hehe... I have a plan.”
“Hm?　No wonder you're God.”
“She broke the thing I was looking forward to the most.”
“Haaa...”
“Fight fire with fire. What's something Kanon would look forward to?”
“Huh, is it lunch?”
“No, fool! Think before you spout nonsense.”
“But I haven't had lunch yet...”
”
“Oh～.”
“Isn't there a volleyball tournament tomorrow?”
“Yeah.”
“Kanon would be heartbroken if that got canceled.”
“Oh, I get it. So are you going to injure her in an ambush?”
“You don't get it at all, do you?”
“Huh? That's not the plan?”
I thought for a moment.
“I'm going to do something much more grand.”
“Huh?”
I took off my headgear.
“Hey, Kyousuke. Explain it in more detail.”
“It's quite simple.”
I cleared my throat for gravity's sake.
“After we're done here, I'm going to sneak into the faculty office and steal the key to the gym storage room.”
“Gym storage room?”
“That's where they keep all the sports equipment... the important thing is, that's where the volleyballs are as well, aren't they?”
“Oh, I see. If they lose the key, they lose the volleyballs.”
“So they'll be forced to suspend tomorrow's game, right?”
Eiichi nodded.
“You're so evil.”
“Yeah, our entire class will be in chaos tomorrow.”
“Even so, do you really have to go that far?”
It seems that fear has begun to grip Eiichi.
“For example, we could just hide Kanon's gym clothes. Isn't that a good idea?”
“The number of suspects would be too limited if we did that. We'd be the first ones suspected.”
“Yeah but, dude, what if we get caught?”
“Just don't get caught. If nobody's caught, it's not a crime.”
“Man, that's some asshole logic right there...”
“I don't want to be called an asshole by you.”
I smirked.
“So. Let's begin...”
“Fine, whatever. Let's get going to the faculty office then.”
“Wait, we're not going right now. There're still a lot of teachers there.”
“Also, the key to the sports equipment room would be in the hands of the club advisers at the moment.”
“Then what should we do?”
I answered him in one breath.
“The club activities should end by nine o'clock. The key would also be returned to the faculty office by then.”
“Teachers don't stay that late unless something unusual comes up.”
“The only teachers on duty from that point forward would be the ones who check the doors and windows.”
Eiichi clapped his hands.
“Ah, Miss Noriko's on duty this week.”
“Exactly.”
“Are we going to get Miss Noriko in on it too and let her steal the key?”
“That's impossible. She'll be in big trouble if she steals the key as a teacher.”
“It's okay. Noriko obeys my every command.”
“......”
“...Okay, that's a lie.”
“Let me continue.”
I rubbed my eyebrows.
“After nine, you head to the faculty office to double-check that the only one in there is Miss Noriko.”
“If she's not the only one?”
“It should be alright. We'll just think of another way, then.”
“Okay. After that?”
“You lure her out of the faculty office.”
“While she's gone, I'll sneak into the faculty office and steal the key.”
“You know where the key is?”
“You know the math teacher's desk?　There are some keys hanging on the wall behind the desk. That's where it is.”
“Oh, yeah. I've seen it.”
“I'll grab the master key while I'm at it. They should be at the same place.”
“Are you following all this?　I can get it done in one minute. You only need to buy that much time for me.”
“Oh, hold on.”
“What?”
“Let's switch roles.”
He looks a bit troubled.
“...You're asking me to lure Miss Noriko out?”
“Mhm...”
He pouted his lip, trying to act cute.
“Because you got rejected by her?”
“Not really. She wasn't that straightforward.”
“Then what is it?”
“She said, ‘Eiichi-kun, you're a liar.’”
He seems to be taking it quite seriously...
“You got hurt?”
“I'll probably freak out when I see her.”
“......”
“You can help me out. Tell her how honest I am.”
“Stop fooling around...”
In all seriousness... I really can't say I'm fond of the idea of calling out Miss Noriko myself.
Explaining to her why I'm still at school at night would be difficult, for one thing.
Tsubaki said it once before. I'm one of those people that heads straight home after school.
If possible, I'd like to avoid doing something unnatural...
“Come on man, please.”
“Fine. Just be quiet.”
“That's why you're God. I'm so following you for the rest of this life.”
“I'll make sure to tell her what an ass you are.”
“What the hell, man!?”
I clicked my tongue.
“Listen, you have to pay attention.”
“What?”
“Before we go in and steal the key at nine, you can't be seen by anyone at school.”
“Why?”
“Use your brain and think.”
I gently knocked his head.
“All they would need to know in order to deduce a list of suspects would be the time the key was stolen.”
“Sometime between the end of club activities at nine and tomorrow morning.”
“That means anyone at school within this time frame will be a suspect.”
“Of course, I'll be suspected, too.”
“Even so, it's okay as long as I'm with Miss Noriko.”
“Ah, yes. If someone saw you, they'd question why you were still at school at night.”
“Understand? You need to pretend to have left school before nine today.”
“Okay, you got it.”
“Well, until the time comes, just hide here.”
I double-checked my plan to see if there was anything wrong.
...Let's see, other than using the room's key and master keys, are there still ways to open the gym storage room...?
It's not like it's a detective novel, where they would just break the lock and force their way in...
Oh well, this is all just a game anyway.
The key will be in the school's mailbox after we're done.
“Hehehe, now Kanon will know my despair. This feels great.”
Eiichi was already excited, like he won the lottery or something.
The sunset dyed the lab equipment storage room in a cornucopia of hues.
Ten minutes after nine, we commenced our plan.
The corridor after school was thick with a bone-chilling air after the lights were switched off.
“Now, go hide in the storeroom or something.”
“Okay. After you lure Miss Noriko out, call me, okay?”
“Be careful when you receive the call, and make sure your phone is on silent.”
“You can count on me.”
“Don't stand beside the windows, alright?　Someone might see you from the outside.”
“I said you can count on me. You worry too much, Kyousuke.”
...And he's certainly not doing a good job of alleviating my fears, that's for sure.
“Okay. Contact me after you've stolen the key.”
“Okay, okay, I'll get in touch immediately.”
“Not immediately. After you steal the key, leave the school without being spotted, then contact me.”
“Yeah yeah.”
Eiichi refused to take this seriously.
“Well, let's go.”
“Put in a good word for me with Miss Noriko, okay?”
I ignored Eiichi's nonsense and headed toward the faculty office.
As expected, only Miss Noriko remained.
“Hey, Miss Noriko? You think I could talk to you for a second?”
She jumped in surprise at the unexpected address, but quickly recovered her mature composure.
“Azai-kun, was it...?　Studying so late?”
“Oh, not at all.”
“I've heard about you. Hardly meeting the minimum attendance quotient, but producing outstanding results. Aren't you quite popular among the girls, as well?”
What a straightforward teacher.
“Um, it's about...”
I confirmed the location of the key as I spoke.
Just as I told Eiichi, the keys are lined up on the wall behind the math teacher's desk.
“About what?”
Now it's time to lead her out of the faculty office.
“Oh, wait. This isn't a good place to chat.”
“Why?　What's wrong with right here?　There's no one around...”
She's a bit suspicious, but that's nothing I wasn't expecting.
“...It's about Eiichi. There's something I want to show you.”
“Eiichi-kun...?”
Miss Noriko's face froze.
“And that thing you want to show me is...?”
“Wait, can you come to the classroom with me?”
“Pardon?”
“Please. You'll understand once you get there.”
I lowered my head slightly.
“I've heard him talk about you before.”
I clenched my fist, and spoke with a trembling voice.
“Eiichi may be stupid, and he can be a little rotten at times, but he's not a bad person.”
I played the part of a nice teenager looking out for his friend.
“So... er, please.”
After a moment, Miss Noriko stood up.
“...Oh well.”
...So far, everything's gone according to plan.
I quickly manipulated the cell phone in my pocket once I was out in the corridor.
...Eiichi, please don't mess this up.
“Um, right here.”
I led Miss Noriko to the classroom.
“I actually wanted to show you Eiichi's desk.”
“His desk...?”
“Right. You'll know when you see it. It's that one.”
Miss Noriko seemed apprehensive as she approached Eiichi's desk.
I started making up stories.
“So?”
“Huh?”
“There's a lot of writing on the desk, right?”
“Not that I can see.　The desk looks immaculate.”
I widened my eyes.
“What?　There's no writing on it?”
“There's nothing.”
“Ah, um... weird...”
I pretended to be in a panic, and averted my eyes.
“That Eiichi. When did he rub it off...?”
“Azai-kun, can you explain what's going on?”
“Well, Eiichi's been thinking about you a lot these days. He had written... oh, how should I put this? He'd written a love confession of sorts on the desk. Phrases like, ‘I love you,’ and things like that were all over it.”
It might be a bald-faced lie, but it's fine as long as I can cover up for it somehow later.
“...Really?”
“Yes. He's actually an innocent and shy person.”
“I see...”
“Sorry, I meant to show this to you sooner.”
Miss Noriko quietly laughed.
“Yeah, it's okay. Don't worry about it. I can see that you're a very thoughtful person.”
“No, not really...”
Really. I'm not.
“I'm really sorry for dragging you out here for nothing. I wanted you to see it when nobody's here in the classroom...”
I pointed out the reason for being at school at this hour.
“Just, please reconsider about Eiichi.”
I didn't forget to help Eiichi out.
“I understand your feelings, but I already have a person in mind.”
“Oh, is that so...?”
Cry, Eiichi.
“I'm sorry.”
“No, it's okay...”
Eiichi should be done by now.
“It's time for me to leave. I apologize for bringing such a sad circumstance to your attention.”
Miss Noriko smiles gently as she watches me go.
The streets may be crowded, but tonight is especially cold.
“Hey, Kyousuke. Sorry for making you wait.”
The pitiable Eiichi finally arrived.
“How did it go?”
“No problem.”
He revealed the two keys.
Seems like he got the master key, too.
I'll take care of them.
“Nobody saw you, right?”
“I said there were no problems, come on man.”
“Did you do anything unnecessary in the faculty office?　Like search through Miss Noriko's desk?”
“N-no, I didn't.”
“We'll be suspended if we're caught, you know.”
“Trust me.”
I'm still a bit worried...
“Oh, well. I can't wait until tomorrow comes...”
“Hehehe, yeah...”
In the middle of the crowd, we burst into chuckles.
The third lesson tomorrow is physical education...
I can already see it now, the devastated look on Kanon's face.
“...Don't you think it's cold?　Like maybe it's going to snow?”
Eiichi sniffled, his red ears quivering.
“I'm going home before I get a cold...”
“Oh, wait, Eiichi.”
While we're on Central Boulevard, I might as well ask him.
“Have you heard of a group called ‘The Boys’?”
Eiichi tilted his head and thought for a moment.
“Yeah, they're famous. I've heard their tickets are impossible to come by on the day of the event. And nightclubs eat 'em up apparently, people love their stuff.”
“Do you know any of the members' names?”
“I've heard there are six of them.”
“Who's the leader?”
“Well, I'm not sure, but...”
“But?”
“It seems like the leader doesn't want to show himself. Normally, leaders greet the audience before the event starts, but he doesn't even do that.”
“Nobody's ever seen him?”
“Wouldn't the members have seen him, at least? Why do you want to know anyway?”
“Actually, the girl I'm with right now likes these kinds of clubs.”
“Oh... I'm surprised a playboy like you had to ask me about something like this.”
“Nah, I appreciate the info.”
The boss never shows up, will he?
If there are six members, though, at least one of them must be in contact with him.
Well, then my course is clear.
If Gonzou's group captures one of the members, that person will spit out the information quickly.
To Gonzou, this is as humiliating as putting mud on one's face. He'd have the kid tortured for it.
Looks like I won't even be needed.
“Well, see you tomorrow.”
“Yeah. I'll be a bit late tomorrow, I have to visit the hospital first thing in the morning.”
“Huh?　The psychiatric ward?”
Eiichi's joking.
“You got me...”
Truth be told, though, I really am going to meet someone from that field.
“You got someone pregnant, didn't you? I admire that.”
He thinks that I'm meeting someone from OB/GYN.
Eiichi finally heads toward the bus station.
If you only counted appearances, that guy would've been as cute as an angel...
“......”
Well now, time to don my other personality.
I thought about the family business as I made phone calls one by one.
I haven't taken part in any illegal dealings. We're trying to give the semblance of a legit company after all, and we don't want the police to pick up on anything funny.
For example, I might provide snacks, towels, ice, handkerchiefs, plants, and artwork to hotels, fast food restaurants, pubs, clubs, etc.
These may be minor accessories, but they still make a great profit when they start adding up.
Central Boulevard is known for its services targeting the younger generation.
To a mafia company like the Azai Corporation that runs on both clean and dirty businesses, that's a treasury of power.
The Azai Corporation has the biggest stake in Central Boulevard right now, but the organizations from Kansai are starting to set their eyes on it again, so we have to stay alert.
“...Right. In order to increase sales in the industry, a little competition would be profitable. So we shouldn't push Kotani under too hard.”
...Are there any outstanding issues that need to be dealt with?
“True... my father is a horrifying monster, but the Azai Corporation is not. Only the Demon Lord in some video game would actually relish in destroying the world.”
...Come to think of it, there's still Shiratori Mizuha.
“Yes, thanks for the help so far. Now there's another issue...”
...Shiratori scorns me because she holds issue with my alleged mafia work at such a young age.
Anyone with an honest job would be shocked after finding out what I really did.
But, it isn't unusual for violent groups to use young people.
They're young, full of energy, ignorant, and rash.
And most importantly, they're protected by the law if and when anything goes sour.
As the vanguard for violence, there is probably no better choice.
The small difference between me and the rest of them, though, is that Gonzou doesn't treat me as just a bullet.
My job's not using my body, but my mind.
From the day I was adopted, Gonzou provided me with everything I needed. He even gave me the opportunity to get an education.
Everything I could imagine was at my fingertips; was utterly obtainable.
However, Gonzou recorded every last penny he ever spent on me.
Not just food and water, either. His criticism ranged from the rent of my tiny room to the cost of my office furniture, even down to a single sheet of tissue. Anything related to life was changed to a form of debt to him.
All the costs, compounded by a steep interest, forced me to use my mind to achieve his ends...
“Right. Well, I'll talk to you again soon...”
The call ended. I sat quietly under the dim streetlights.
Nearly every problem in this world can be solved with money.
Take Central Boulevard as an example.
Its very composition is undeniably intertwined with the almighty yen.
Cell phones ringing everywhere, women with brand-name dresses. There's a road repair project underway as the end of the year nears...
Even the early winter's cold night sky is engulfed by the aura of the Sannou Corporation building.
“I'll crush all of this...”
Then, at the exact moment I whispered this to myself...
“Sure is cold...”
“...!?”
When did she appear?
Usami stood in front of me before I knew it.
“Oh... Usami? You sure are playing around quite late, aren't you?”
“Not really. As I've said earlier, I have a part-time job. I'm going home now.”
“Really? What would that job be?”
“Uh, I have a request...”
“You weren't listening, were you...?”
...I really don't like this girl.
“Uh, sorry. I tend to bring down the people around me. It happens so much that I was a hotshot among the emo kids a while back.”
“......”
“I really am bad with huge crowds. I have bad habits like hunching over while walking, and staring at the ground, and counting the white lines on the crosswalk. Stuff like that.”
“...What are you trying to say?”
“Ah, the fruit stall. I mainly sell bananas.”
“Enough, I understand. So what is it that you want?”
Usami tilted her head.
“Could you lend me your cell phone?”
“My cell phone?　You don't have one?”
“Yes. I'm not used to making calls.”
“It's not just calls. You're not used to communication itself, are you?”
“That's not true.”
...Clearly she doesn't know the first thing about herself.
“Um, I forgot my wallet when I left the stall. The stall will close if I don't call soon. Sorry for being so sudden.”
“......”
Something's not right here.
This annoying woman... is she trying to check my call logs behind the guise of a long conversation?
“...Ah, sorry.”
“What?”
“I don't have my cell phone with me right now.”
“You don't have it?”
Usami's eyes widened as if she were shocked to the bone.
“I think I dropped it about an hour ago. I'm actually looking for it now.”
Her pure eyes twinkled.
“That's a lie.”
“...What?”
Usami's focus slowly moved from my eyes to the right.
“Pretty cold today, isn't it?”
“......”
“My ears are so cold that they're turning red.”
...I see.
“But only your left ear is red. Which means that you had something pressed against your right up until now.”
...This girl is pretty sharp.
“Okay, okay. Sorry, I just wanted to fool around with you. Don't glare at me like that.”
“Ah, it's no problem. I was joking too. We could've just laughed over it if you had said your right ear withstands the cold better.”
“...Sorry.”
I made my usual slack smile.
“...It's okay.”
Usami also made a creepy smile.
I handed my cell phone over, and Usami started dialing immediately.
“Hello, I'm Usami from part-time... Right, long-and-scattered-haired Usami. The stall owner's still there? Great...”
She returned to her lazy mood.
The more I learn about her, the weirder she gets...
Though I will admit that she's a genius at making others feel nervous...
Or is it only me that she affects so strongly?
I feel like that stare of hers sees everything within me.
“Okay, thanks. I'm done with the call.”
“Oh, found your wallet?”
“Oh, yeah. Looks like I dropped it when I was putting the bananas in the fridge after closing. The stall owner picked it up afterwards.”
“You're pretty clumsy...”
“It might not be something to be proud of. I get scolded all the time for it at work.”
She started scratching her head lazily.
“Alright. Bye, sorry for the trouble...”
Usami turned her back toward me and continued forward.
“So, what's your real job?”
“What?”
Usami turned around.
It might have just been my imagination, but Usami seemed a little happy.
“Working at a fruit stall is a lie, isn't it?”
...Geez.
“What exactly do you mean?”
...What's her motive?
“To keep the flavor properly, one should never refrigerate bananas. That's even more crucial as a salesman than a consumer.”
...She must've already recognized this. She's trying to test me.
“Ah, right, that's true. You got me. You're so smart, Azai-san, you saw through my lie in an everyday conversation.”
...Don't fuck with me.
“Haha... and you, Usami, are such an interesting person.”
...So basically, she never actually had any intention of borrowing my cell phone.
“Aww, that's not true. I'm really sorry, but my true workplace is a secret. Thanks.”
...Why is she trying to get close to me?
“However, there's something else I'd like to bring up, seeing as we've said so much already. Would that be alright with you?”
...Here it comes.
“Hm?　What is it?”
...The next point will be the crux of the conversation.
“No, it's not really that important, but...”
Usami straightened her back slowly as she spoke.
“Do you know ‘Maou’?”
“Huh...?”
It's not a word one hears often, so I thought I had misheard her.
Usami glared at me with stern eyes.
“What's ‘Maou’?　Some Demon Lord in an RPG video game?”
“A game? Perhaps you could say that.”
“I'm not sure what you mean. If you're looking for game walkthroughs, wouldn't it be better to search on the net?”
“He's not some underleveled enemy that you can find out about online.”
“Enemy...?”
“Yes, an enemy.”
The lazy ambiance which had dominated the conversation up until now disappeared in an instant.
“So you don't know?”
“Why would I?”
“I came to this city to look for ‘Maou’.”
“...Are you serious?”
If so, then the only thing I can think is that you're a bit mad.
“That's all I want to say.”
“Huh?”
“I'm searching for ‘Maou’, and I just wanted to let you know that.”
“......”
I had no reply.
Nevertheless, Usami's eyes reflected something beyond mere determination. They reflected absolute hatred.
“Sorry for bothering you...”
Her footsteps vanished into the crowd of Central Boulevard.
“......”
Usami is looking for something called the ‘Maou’.
She's probably referring to a specific person.
...Something feels wrong.
Usami may be a strange woman, but she's clearly smart enough to be aware of what she's doing.
So then why would she say something that would arouse suspicions of insanity?
And why would she say it to me...?
“...Time to go home...”
Even if I think about it, I'll just come up with nothing.
Nothing except: Usami Haru... called herself a hero.
A being of justice that subdues the strong and helps the weak.
You don't find those kinds of people. If such an extraordinary exception existed, I'd like to see it.
It gets on my nerves, even if it was just a joke.
And as for me, I'd rather play the role of the Devil...
　At this time of day, the region of downtown Tomanbetsu City called Central Business was enveloped in the darkness of night.[l] Row upon row of colossal buildings sheltered the deserted streets from the cold winter air.[l] Still, even wild dogs and the homeless stayed away from Central Business.
　The offices of hundreds of powerful companies line-up against each other within this single district.[l] During business hours, famous celebrities from all around the world pass through this area, and invariably show up on the media.[l] Some business magazines have gone so far as to call Tomanbetsu's Central Business the second-largest Japanese economic powerhouse, following Tokyo's business district.
　In the region's center lies an especially eye-catching enormous high-rise...[l] A gargantuan tower with fifty stories above ground and six beneath.[l] It was designed with the purpose of overlooking the entire city in mind, a purpose not unlike that of the company it houses.
　The headquarters of Sannou Corporation —— one of Japan's top conglomerates.
　When the other offices went into slumber, only this firm remained awake.[l] In that they acquired intelligence from agents all around the world, the data simply couldn't be processed without a 24-hour work schedule.
　In the deepest part of the building stood ‘Maou’.[l] The seventh floor beneath the surface; a floor which should not have existed at all.[l] The hidden chamber.[l] It belonged to the Sannou Coporation, yes, but only a very select few were allowed to enter.[l] The average employee would not even be aware of its existence.
　This building had more security systems installed than any other in Central Business.[l] Surveillance cameras, metal detectors, they had it all.[l] The only access to this room was an elevator that led directly to the ground floor.[l] For emergencies, triple reinforced glass separated the elevator's door from the entrance to the secret room.
“Even if someone was murdered in this room, the evidence could easily be concealed.”
　A lone male said this.[l] A man in a double-layered suit, who looked to be somewhere in his fifties.[l] A few strands of gray popped out from his head of neatly-combed hair.[l] His Sannou Corporation ID badge reflected a dull light under the dim fluorescent lamp.
“I'm very sorry for calling you out this late, but I would like to remind you that I too am pressed for time.”
　The man's tone portrayed his strong confidence.[l] His name was Someya.[l] As Sannou Corporation's director of senior management and head of corporate strategy, he holds absolute power in this company.[l] A single order from this man could cause the Nikkei Index to fluctuate.[l] A single phrase could drive an employee to take his own life.
　Nevertheless, ‘Maou’ merely stared blankly at the wall before him.
“You've been senior management's strategist from the shadows for nearly a year now, isn't that right?”
　Rather than nodding, ‘Maou’ calmly rearranged his position.
“In the beginning, I thought you were just another outsider. Even with a recommendation from the CEO, this company has been in business for eighty proud years without letting outsiders get involved so easily.”
　He's beating around the bush.[l] Perhaps that particular tendency comes with the territory for someone working in the trade business.[l] ‘Maou’ looked at Someya emotionlessly.
“True, the effects of your actions are very remarkable. Thanks to you, our company finally got a foothold in the previously monopolistic military industries. Also, the layoff that allowed the company to get rid of the so-called ‘large enterprise disease’ was necessary, as you suggested. Other than those...”
　He showed no sign of stopping the praise.[l] However, ‘Maou’ already sensed the truth lying behind Someya's words.[l] Thus, he finally began to speak.
“What you want to say is, you don't need me anymore?”
　His quiet voice went straight to the point.[l] Someya went silent.
“You gained huge profits by following my orders.”
“...Y-yes.”
“But at the same time, started many projects that can't be revealed to the public eye.”
“...Our company is taking too many risks.”
“Because of me?”
“Because of that devil's brain of yours.”
　Someya's lips quivered.[l] ‘Maou’ knows.[l] Someya may be in a position of power within an enormous company, but that only applies to the workings of the company itself.[l] With respect to the illegal acts planned by ‘Maou’, he was a mere greenhorn.
“To be frank with you, I want you to go to South America.”
“That's pretty warm.”
　‘Maou’ let a subtle laugh escape his lips.[l] Someya tried to smooth things over.
“You should go into hiding for a while until things calm down.”
“That's pretty warm,” ‘Maou’ repeated again.
“Yes, it's warm there. I've already prepared a resort over there. I promise you, you won't be treated unfairly...”
　‘Maou’ shook his head.
“Wrong.”
“W-what's wrong?”
“I'm saying your sheltered little psyche is warm.”
　Someya cringed as if he'd bit his tongue.
“You should take care of me a bit more thoroughly if I'm truly in your way.”
“...Thoroughly?”
　Just then, the elevator doors opened.[l] A man in white entered.[l] Someya's face turned to the side.[l] He welcomed the man with eyes that cried for help.
“Allow me to introduce someone. This is Kuwashima-kun...”
　He was a young man that looked to be in his mid-twenties.[l] He was pale and frail-looking, but his eyes seemed to glow with an eerie sheen.[l] He seemed like the type that would be more at home in a laboratory than a business enterprise.
“This is our company's new consultant. He's from Boston University. We had him come out here as a huge favor.”
“My successor, then?”
“I studied game theory during my time there.”
　Kuwashima spoke with a husky voice.
“I hear they call you ‘Maou’, so I was looking forward to seeing just what kind of person you are, but I wasn't expecting someone so young. I'm twenty-six this year, but you must be even younger than me.”
“For a game theory specialist, you sure like revealing information about yourself...”
“I heard about you from Mr. Someya.”
　‘Maou’ took a look at Someya.[l] That motion alone filled Someya with fear.
“K-Kuwashima-kun's already an employee. It doesn't matter if he knows, does it?”
“An employee? I see... a big company like Sannou Corporation certainly wouldn't want to rely on an outsider like me.”
“This is a transfer of power. From now on, Sannou Corporation will enter a clean and open new era.”
　Kuwashima continued his pretentious speech.[l] ‘Maou’ didn't hate young men who were blinded by pride.[l] He smiled as he thought... ‘Oh, come, lovely child.’
“What, you have something you want to say?”
“Sure enough, you might be a genius. However, you have yet to accomplish anything, correct?”
　Kuwashima sneered.
“Listen, Boyo. Business strategy is all about theory. Results always come out of it sooner or later. It's been statistically proven that people like myself with a firm grasp of business theory provide results for their corporations.”
“Sounds reliable...”
　‘Maou’ slowly walked toward Kuwashima.
“Let's play a game.”
“A game?”
“If you win, I'll step down gracefully. Treat this as your employment test.”
　Kuwashima smiled as ‘Maou’ finished.
“No problem. What's the game?”
　‘Maou’ stretched his left arm and held it out before Kuwashima.[l] He spread out each finger and pointed it at the man before him.
“You show your fingers, too.”
　Kuwashima held out his left hand.
“Now you and I have ten fingers in total.”
“Even ‘Maou’ has only five fingers.”
　‘Maou’ continued calmly, ignoring Kuwashima's mockery.
“The rules are simple. We will both take turns and use our right hands to bend these ten fingers.”
“The finger bending game? I'm pretty good at this.”
“You can bend either two fingers or one during your turn, but you cannot bend fingers from the same hand twice in a row.”
“One or two, and the person who bends the last finger wins?”
“You're smart. Any questions?”
　Then, Kuwashima quietly chuckled.[l] He was trying to conceal his amusement; it seemed that his laughter was directed at what he considered to be his opponent's stupidity.
“I have a proposal, ‘Maou’.”
“What is it?”
“May I have the first move?”
　‘Maou’ nodded.[l] Kuwashima smirked as his proposal was approved.
“But I have an idea as well.”
“Anything's fine with me. Please go ahead.”
“A twenty second time limit for each turn. What do you think?”
“Twenty seconds?　Ten should be enough.”
“Is ten seconds really okay?”
“Yep.”
“You sure?”
“Enough discussion. Let's start already.”
　‘Maou’ and Kuwashima faced each other.[l] Each spread his left hand and straightened his fingers.
“So, let the game begin. I'm going first.”
　Kuwashima bent his own thumb with his right hand.
“This is the first move.”
　Since they began with Kuwashima's thumb, the person who bends ‘Maou's’ little finger will be the winner.
　‘Maou’ bent his own thumb,[l] and Kuwashima's index finger.
“Your turn. Time limit's ten seconds.”
“Hmph...”
　Kuwashima bent ‘Maou's’ index finger with a confident look on his face.
“One's enough?”
“Yes. My victory has already been set in stone.”
　‘Maou’ bent two fingers during his next turn.[l] Kuwashima's middle finger, and then his own.[l] Kuwashima chuckled afterward.
“Don't make me laugh, ‘Maou’.”
“What is it?”
“This is precisely the game where the person to count the number ten wins. Even middle school students know how to win at this.”
　Kuwashima touched his own ring finger as he laughed uncontrollably.
“My ring finger is the seventh in the game. Winning is easy once you look at it backwards. To bend the last finger, whoever reaches the seventh first wins.”
“Ah...”
“You must bend the fourth to bend the seventh, and you must bend the first to bend the fourth. Which means the person who takes the first turn has a guaranteed victory from the beginning.”
　‘Maou’ listened to Kuwashima's explanation quietly.
“Meaning, when I put the seventh finger down, ‘Maou’ can only bend the eighth, or the eighth and ninth at the same time. If you bend the eighth, I'll follow with the ninth and tenth. If you take both the eighth and the ninth, I'll bend the tenth directly.”
　Then, Kuwashima finally put the seventh finger――his own ring finger――down.
“You're talking too much. It's already far beyond the time limit.”
　‘Maou’ said this calmly.
“Though I would love to say you've already lost, I'll let you off just this one time.”
“Worthy of the name ‘Maou’. Thank you for your generosity.”
“But there won't be a second time. Let's continue.”
“Continue the game?　Don't you get what I just said?”
　Three fingers remain.
　The eighth――‘Maou's’ ring finger...
　The ninth――Kuwashima's little finger...
　And the tenth――‘Maou's’ little finger.
“Are you stupid?　I just put the seventh finger down! You're going to lose no matter what!”
“You never know who's going to win until the end.”
　‘Maou’ put down his ring finger,[l] then stretched his right hand toward Kuwashima's pinkie.
“...What an ignorant person. Mr. Someya, would you acknowledge me already?”
　Kuwashima was drunk on his victory, but then it happened.
“――Eee!!!”
　Suddenly, Kuwashima screamed.[l] He didn't clearly understand what had just happened,[l] but his suffering and shock were plain on his face.
“Eeeek, w-what did yo-!?”
　As opposed to the panicked Kuwashima, ‘Maou’ didn't make the slightest reaction.
“It's ‘bent’ rather nicely, isn't it?”
“...Woo, aaah.”
“Once you've experienced it, you'll know that it doesn't really hurt that much when you break your little finger.”
　Kuwashima's face turned pale.[l] His finger was pointing in an impossible direction.[l] It was no doubt a shock to a researcher like Kuwashima.
　‘Maou’ had truly bent his pinkie.
“Now, it's your turn. You said that ten seconds was plenty, yes?”
　Kuwashima didn't respond.[l] Instead, he bent down and shivered in pain.
“What's wrong? As I've said before, you can't go over the time limit twice. Come on, my pinkie is the only finger left. All you have to do is bend it and you win.”
“H-help me...!”
　Kuwashima's already abandoned all thoughts about the game.
　The match was decided.[l] ‘Maou’ put down his arm and spoke to the man before him as he whimpered like a small animal.
“I knew your capabilities as a strategist from your very first move.”
　‘Maou’ continued his speech without a shred of pride at his victory.
“Just as you said, in this game, the person who takes the first move wins. Everyone knows that, yes, but it's precisely because everyone knows it that you should stop to think more deeply about it.”
　Kuwashima's face lurched as he blocked his forehead with the back of his hand.[l] He has already understood his complete failure.
“You should have broken my thumb with your first move. Unlike the little finger, breaking one's thumb is quite painful. That's why I suggested the twenty-second time limit. I wanted twenty seconds to be able to withstand the pain and shock of a broken thumb.”
“O-oh my God... snapping someone's finger just like that...”
“You can't be a corporate strategist if you hesitate to hurt someone. A word from us can destroy a company, break a family, or force an employee to suicide. It's not a job for a normal human being.”
　‘Maou’ glanced at Someya, standing in the corner of the room like a decoration.
“Mr. Someya, do you understand?”
“...Mh, mhm.”
　Sweat started pouring from Someya's forehead,[l] as if he just now realized how terribly powerful ‘Maou’ really was.
“If you truly find me an unnecessary hindrance to your company, I would advise you to do something less reckless than simply ship me off to South America.”
“......”
“That's a very lenient decision. After all, I still have unfinished business, and I need this company's help to finish it. I have yet to receive any proper compensation for the profits I have earned for the company. If I were to be treated unfairly like that, I would have ended up taking revenge on the Sannou Corporation.”
“I... I understand...”
　Someya raised his arms nervously.[l] ‘Maou’ continued closing in.
“You said this before, didn't you? That even if someone died here, it would be easily concealed?”
“I said I understand...”
“You should kill me. That would be the best way.”
“S-stop!”
　‘Maou’ knows how to control his fellow man.[l] He simply causes pain without hesitation.[l] Someya and Kuwashima can't do this.[l] Just now, ‘Maou’ demonstrated this lethal distinction.[l] This distinction, and the magnificent, overwhelming strength of violence...
“Damned demon...”
　Someya's curse was only a compliment to the ‘Maou’.
Anyway, I had better calm Usami down before she mashes my groin into a bloody pulp.
“Hey, Usami.”
“I know, I get it!”
“I haven't even said anything yet. Look, just calm down.”
“I-I'm just fine.”
I really hope so...
“Just make sure you watch it with the teeth. That hurts like hell...”
“...Oh, I see... so that's why it throbbed earlier.”
Was she honestly under the impression that I made it do that?
“Okay, I'll be more careful...”
This time she touched me softly, with more reservation.
Usami was able to cool her head.
Then again, her flushing cheeks were not what you would normally associate with cool.
“Don't move, Azai-san...”
“Chp...”
“Nhh...”
“Chp, tch, pch...”
She diligently, lovingly kissed my penis.
The tip, the frenulum, the rod...
Moving my hard penis clumsily with her hand, Usami rained kisses down onto it.
“Ch... nn, ah, tch, chh...”
“Nn... wow... I can feel it getting harder and harder.”
Having Usami do this for me is really intense.
I'd never even thought of doing this with her, so my back muscles are tingling with pleasure.
“Chh... kch...”
“There's something coming out the tip... chp...”
“Ahh.”
I let a shameful moan out.
Usami continues kissing me as she slowly strokes it.
“Kh...”
“Looks like it feels good, Azai-san.”
“Y-yeah...”
“That's good... want me to keep going...?”
I nod.
“......”
Usami opens her mouth a little and sticks her tongue out a bit.
Her lips are wet with saliva.
Her dripping tongue stretches out for me.
“Hhm... tch, kch, chp...”
“Kh, ah...”
This sensation is even stronger than the kissing.
“Pch... chk, tch, tch, chh, chp...”
She licks up the frenulum...
...Then goes down my incredibly stiff shaft and begins to swirl her tongue around.
“Nm... chp, hch, tch, ktch, pch...”
The tip continues dripping as proof of my pleasure, but Usami laps it up each time.
“Nn, chh... mm, it's bitter...”
“Chrrh, chhr, tch, chh...”
Her soft, wet tongue pokes at my rod.
Each time, my crotch goes more and more numb.
“Chh... chhp, chhr, chr, hchh, nchh, kchh, hah...”
Her tongue licks me inside and out.
Usami's well-formed, lovely face envelops my penis...
Just that makes me feel like exploding.
“Chh, chhr, chr... pch, tch, mm, mh, kchh, chh...”
Foamy saliva spills out of Usami's mouth.
“Haahn... ah, mm, mmm...”
Lewd, wet sounds echo through my room.
“Pphaah... mm... Azai-san... it's starting to twitch...”
“Chh... hah... nn, kch...”
“Haaah, ahh, hhm.”
Her hands speed up a bit.
“Does... does that feel good...? Hahh, chh, chh, chh...”
“Hamn, chhh... chh, hah, nn, chh.”
“Nch, hmn, mm, mn, mm!”
Usami's fingers are already soaking wet.
“Oooh, yeah... it's fantastic...”
“I see, that's good to hear... chh, hahhmm, kchh, chh.”
“Hammmch, chh, hhhm, hh, mm, chr, chp.”
Usami seems to be enjoying pleasuring me as well.
Her shoulders are trembling slightly.
I move my hips a little, as if to pierce her throat.
It seems to hurt Usami a bit, but she doesn't stop.
“Hahh, mm, I'm... I'm also kind of... chrrh, chhh.”
“Chh, hhhhnnnn! Mm, mn, hah... ah... aaaaahhhh!”
I ejaculate.
“Hhhhnnnn!?”
I feel a sense of release as I eject my lust into Usami's mouth.
Spasm after spasm fires from my body.
“Hh, mm, haahhh, nn... nnn...”
Semen overflows from her mouth.
Nonetheless, she fights to keep it all in.
“Hah, hah, hah, hah...”
The excess semen pours down the corner of her lip.
“Nn... hah... nn, there's so much...”
“Y-you alright?”
“Yeah... you've got quite the cannon on you though, don't you...?”
“...Chhr...”
While being careful not to spill any more of my fluid from her mouth...
“...Nnghh, kkh, nn, kkh...”
...She guzzled it down.
“Hey, you don't have to do that.”
“Mm, gulp... kchh, hah, hah, hah...”
“Phew... I'm fine. It's yours, so...”
How can she say something so embarrassing...?
“There was so much of it...”
She explained to me through strangely feverish breaths.
The image of her heaving breaths after swallowing my seed brought my penis to attention again.
I push Usami onto the bed.
“Wh-... A-Azai-san, what are you doing!?”
“What am I doing...? There's only one thing to do.”
“A-are we pro wrestling!?”
“Why would we do that...?”
Usami's started panicking again...
Talking with her is tedious, so I decide to reach for Usami's vulva instead.
“Hah!?”
The moment my hand touched it, Usami's body jerked.
“Wh-where do you think you're touching me!?”
“Should I draw you a diagram?”
“Nn... ah, hah!”
I trace upwards along her already-wet slit.
I thought her breathing seemed a little heavy, but Usami really had gotten excited from licking my penis.
“Don't touch me there! It's embarrassing!”
“That's not too convincing after you touched mine plenty.”
“I-I guess, but... that's totally different!”
The hell it is.
I feel for Usami's slit again.
“Ah, uwa, nn... hah, nn!”
Usami tries to get away, but each time my finger touches her she trembles and can't.
“A-Azai-sa-... s-stop i-... hah!?”
I touch it again, as if to shut her up.
Usami keeps shaking her head while moaning in ecstasy.
“You're sure wet for someone who doesn't want it.”
Usami responds by gazing into my eyes with embarrassment.
“Azai-san, you're acting like some bad guy...”
“That's because I am a bad guy.”
I press a finger inside Usami's body as I answer her.
“Hh, kwahh! D-don't do that...”
Usami moans with a mixture of pleasure and pain.
But despite her moans, pleasure must be winning out downstairs. Her walls are sucking at my finger.
“Do you really want me to stop? If you do, I will.”
“Kh, hh... mm, you're such a... a tease...”
“It's not... it's not that I don't want you to... I'm just kind of... scared...”
She seems both scared and excited from my actions, she just doesn't know which emotion to listen to.
“...It's alright, you don't have to be scared.”
Usami stares at my face for a while after my attempt to calm her, then nods slightly.
Apparently it worked rather well.
It should be fine now.
I decide it's time to put my penis to her crotch.
“...I'm putting it in.”
“Nh...! O-okay.”
She was surprised at first, but just nodded in response.
I put the tip of my penis to her slit.
The tip kisses her vagina.
“Ah... it's... it's so hot...”
“Yours is too.”
It seems Usami is putting too much strength in, as she's shaking.
“I'll go slowly.”
“O-okay...”
I guide my tip into her hole.
“Nn, kh...”
Usami squeezes her eyes shut.
My tip pushes apart the narrow hole.
“Hhh, uhh, ahh... haaaahh... o-oww!”
Before even the head had made it in, Usami's body stiffened up.
“So it does hurt?”
“Very... very much so, yes!”
With tears in her eyes, she frantically tries to bear it.
“I don't know what I would do if it were anyone but you...”
“I-I see...”
I put a bit more strength into my thrust, and penetrate her body.
“Haaahhh...!”
Then I stop again and kiss Usami.
I just wanted to get her mind off the pain.
“Nnp, chh, chrr, chh...”
“Hh... hah, mm... haah, hhh...”
She's so tight that even I'm in pain.
I push my hips closer to hers.
My rod gradually becomes enveloped in her soft folds.
“Nn... Haaaah!”
I pierce her hymen in one go, and I'm inside.
It's painfully tight.
I look down, and blood is trickling down my penis from inside Usami.
Her wet flesh tries to reject me, but I can't retreat now.
For Usami's sake, as much as mine.
“You feel so good, Usami.”
“I'm... I'm still in some... some extreme... pain, here...”
“So could you just... stay like this, for a bit...?”
“Alright.”
I'm almost all the way in now.
We've come this far, so it won't hurt anything to stop for a bit.
Well, aside from my urge to ejaculate.
I kiss Usami's neck.
“Ah... hh, y-you're being so gentle... nn...”
“...I am? Nah, no way...”
Usami smiled a little.
“I can... I can feel you...”
“I can feel you inside me...”
My penis is constantly throbbing.
Usami must feel it too.
“......”
“I should be fine now... you can move.”
Usami nods.
“Alright.”
I start moving in and out.
“Haaahm!”
Wide thrusts would probably hurt her, so I move only a little bit at a time.
I can hear sloppy sounds coming from where we're connected.
“Hhwaaaann, haaahn, aaahh, wah.”
Each time I change direction, Usami's voice gets louder.
The small movements I was supposed to be taking had quickly turned into bigger movements, and the bed started squeaking.
“If you... if you do it so hard... nn, I'll... Nn... hah!”
“Haaahh... aaahn, nn... kh, hahhh!”
Usami's body jumps around.
“Nk... hhhnn, hah... ahh, nn, aaaahh...!”
“Azai-san... nn, do it... kh, slowe-... ahh!”
Usami looked to be in pain, so I went back to my slighter motions.
“Nn, ahh, ahh... hkh... th-, don-... nnn!”
I swing my hips.
“Aaahh, ah... hh... hwaaa, haahnn, nnn!”
“Ahh, nkh... you're... you're hitting my, my insides... hhah!”
Each time my tip grazes her soft walls, I almost let out a moan.
Her ample breasts are shaking in front of me.
That stimulates me in itself, and I'm beginning to have trouble holding back my imminent ejaculation.
“Kh... I'm... I'm gonna... cum...”
When I tell her that, Usami wraps her arms tightly around my back.
“Haaahm! A-Azai-san! Ahh, ah, ah!”
Her copious juices, both lubricant and blood, allow me to move smoothly despite this incredibly tight space.
“Uwaah, haaannn! Haaah! Nnaaah! Aaah!”
Each time I move in and out, wet noises slap around the room.
Her walls tighten around me and wriggle about, as if to squeeze the semen out of me.
“I'm, I'm almost there...”
“P-please... cum inside me, Azai-san...!”
I squeeze out the last of my energy.
My shaft, stiff to its limits, furiously digs at her narrow vagina.
“Uwaah, kyahh, haaah, aan!”
My crotch gets hotter and hotter, and conversely my back gets colder.
“Azai-san... I-I'm... I'm gonna, you know, too... haaah, aaah.... uwaaa!”
She squeezes my penis.
“Aaah, aaaan! Nnaaa, aah! Khaaa!”
“Usami... I'm cumming...!”
“Ah, ah... aanhaaa, aaaaahhh!!”
Usami's body jerks, and I spew out semen.
I spurt out into her body.
“Hah, ah... nn, hah... ah.”
Wave after wave of pleasure courses through me as I disgorge my seed.
Each time my penis throbs, Usami's insides are painted with my semen.
“I-it's so warm... hahh...”
“Uu... hah, hah... hah... hahh...”
An ecstatic expression washes over Usami as her breathing grows rougher.
“Hahh... hah... hah...”
“Hah... there's... there's so much of it, Azai-san...”
I cum inside her over and over, and finally the long ejaculation stops.
“Hah, hah, hah...”
Usami heaves with each breath as her body trembles all over.
“Hah, hah, haaah...”
In the end, she exhales one last time, then lets the strength flee her body.
　Kanon had always been cold to her mother, Ikuko.
　She had no idea when she began to feel such discontent concerning her mother.[l] For all Kanon knew, her heart had been dead since she entered adulthood.[l] For whatever reason, her mother simply seemed abnormal to her childish mind.[l] She was just too beautiful, and obsessed with keeping up appearances.
“Mom, where's Papa?”
　‘Non-chan’ was not supposed to know.
“Non-chan, do you like skating? It's fun, right? Lots and lots of people are really happy when you skate. I'm happy when you skate, too. So Non-chan just needs to devote herself to skating, and not worry about anything else.”
“Okay, but... everyone else has a Papa.”
“Non-chan is different from everyone else. She's special. Look, can anyone jump on the ice like you?”
“No.”
　Children are sensitive to lies, and Kanon was a particularly sensitive girl.[l] Thus, even at that age, she understood that her mother was hiding something from her.[l] Her mother's surname was Kanesaki, so why was her surname Azai?[l] However, though their names may have been different, Ikuko had doted on Kanon far too strongly for Kanon to see her as a complete stranger.
　Ikuko gave Kanon everything she ever wanted.[l] From lovely dolls, to the latest video games, to adorable clothes which any of Kanon's friends would envy.
“I'll do anything for you, Kanon-chan. We can always make more money. It was the same for me.”
　Kanon quickly grew tired of it all.[l] After winning various competitions as a child, she soon discovered a fundamental truth about human nature: that getting what you want isn't as satisfying unless you earned it yourself.
　Her wish for a father was finally realized after receiving――and while she was still in grade school, no less――a special invitation to compete in the Japan Championships on a Senior level.[l] Until that point, she had been competing in the Novice A lists; not even at the Junior level.[l] Despite being unable to bring home the title, her Papa had stroked her head kindly at their first encounter.
“I'll be taking care of you from now on. You can have anything you want. If you don't like your mother, I'll get you a new one.”
　Although Kanon did not understand her father's words, she was relieved to know that she, too, had a father.[l] For the first time, she felt glad she started skating.
“Mom, I met Papa! Papa came!”
“Oh really?”
“He said I did good!”
“Did he now?”
　As she watched Kanon laugh and dance, Ikuko bathed in discontent.[l] ‘Go fuck yourself...’ she muttered under her breath.[l] Hearing her, Kanon's heart froze once again.
　Kanon's day-to-day life of skating rolled ever-forward.[l] Ikuko was extremely kind.[l] She detested coaches who swore at their athletes, and cared for Kanon as well as she could.[l] It had reached the point where Kanon had started to consider Ikuko's instruction to be nothing more than flattery.
　But even still, for the sake of victory, Kanon was expected to give many more times the effort than anyone else.[l] In order to maintain her weight, her lifestyle was harshly controlled.[l] She would stay awake the whole night beside the sleeping Ikuko watching recordings of her performances.[l] When her first menstrual cycle came, she gained weight and had trouble managing it.[l] It was only after seeking help from a sports medicine expert at a prestigious university that she was able to rebuild her physical condition from the ground up.[l] Behind all this torturous training, though, Kanon maintained her smile for the media, taking time out of her schedule regularly to mold her image as the ‘genius skating girl’.
“Well, Kanon-chan, it looks like your mother has nothing more to teach you.”
　Ikuko eventually retired from the ice.[l] She stood beside the rink as a stranger, occasionally pointing out small mistakes.
　Officials from the International Skating Union wanted to separate Kanon and Ikuko.[l] However, a change of coaches was never enforced, due in part to ‘Kanon's strong opposition to it’.[l] And yet Kanon had no memory of ever opposing such a thing...
　In the end, Kanon's full potential remained underutilized until the famous coach George Hilton confronted the International Skating Union on her behalf.[l] She may have gotten by in the Novice and Junior lists using only her natural talent, but the Senior level, with its many great, experienced skaters, was more competitive than Kanon could have dreamed.
　All responsibility fell onto Ikuko.[l] After last year's fiasco, Ikuko's coaching ability was called into question.
“I'm sorry, Kanon-chan. It's my fault. I'm sorry for being so inefficient.”
　The mother would often apologize to her daughter.
　[nm t="郁子" s=yuu_7050]“It's all my fault. You did nothing wrong, Kanon-chan.”
　Officials and sponsors from the event, reporters, agents, school teachers... she beseeched various people in various fields.[l] Ikuko's position as Kanon's mother was a small one to begin with, but she had been demoted even further to the level of just ‘a coach.’[l] Yet at the same time, Kanon's arrogance continued to swell.[l] Kanon knew she was being arrogant, but could do nothing about it.[l] Like a rebellious child who wants to kill his parents but knows he can't actually do it, a tiny ‘devil’ was planted within Kanon's heart.
　And as it grew, that ‘Maou’ of the ice closed the doors to her heart with hatred, endlessly repeating her mother's words.
“Non-chan did nothing wrong.”
　That's right.
　After all, who'd ever want to submit to anyone...?
　At last, Kanon fell to the plotting demon.
　Time stopped.
　There was no pain, no fear.
　A triple lutz, then a triple toe loop.[l] Her double-triple was a surefire way to score well.[l] Yet it was not the outside edge of Kanon's right skate that collided with the ice, but her back, which hadn't come crashing down since her collision last year.
　‘Strange,’ Kanon thought.
　‘Why is there no applause?[l] Why am I in such a position?[l] Why is the music leaving me behind without my permission?’
　The lutz is considered a particularly difficult counter-rotated jump.[l] That was exactly why Kanon had practiced so hard on it during training.[l] She'd trained until the height-distance ratio of her jump was perfected.[l] She'd continued training until the audience connected Azai Kanon herself with the triple lutz.[l] That very jump, which should have been the celebratory champagne for her glorious victory, betrayed Kanon in the eleventh hour, a mere fifteen seconds into the free skate.
　――‘I can't win.’
　‘I'll lose.’[l] She fell on the ice and interrupted her performance.[l] She'd already lost many points.[l] With programs as precise as a machine, a single loose screw could cause total collapse.
　Her victory was long-gone.[l] The triumph that was so easily hers...
　Who was it?
　Feelings buried in Kanon's heart bared their fangs.
　Who was to blame for this...?
　After all, Non-chan did nothing wrong――
...
......
I flipped open tonight's newspaper.
They too made Kanon's disappointing performance out to be the scoop of the century.
I couldn't tear myself away from the television or internet that night.
If Kanon had merely fallen down, it wouldn't have been an issue, but she stopped and stared at the ice for a whole twelve seconds.
Even I'm wondering why Kanon failed to stand up again.
It's not rare for a skater to fall down during a competition.
They make an adjustment and continue their program, no matter who they are.
Hell, if they only fall down once, they still have a shot at the gold.
However, Kanon continued beyond the regulated free skate duration, and skated overtime. She caused quite a ruckus amongst the spectators, and not in a good way.
Cold eyes poured on Kanon from every direction.
I understood the reason after listening to a television interview.
“‘Motivated? Of course I was motivated.’”
Numerous shining floodlights, numerous waiting microphones, welcomed Kanon as she left the arena.
“‘I've told you all before, how many times do I need to repeat myself?’”
Kanon pushed the reporters away without even an attempt to hide her displeasure.
“‘I heard that someone was gonna kill Coach... er, uh, Ikuko-san. So I hesitated... hey, let me through!’”
This is terrible...
Someone wants to kill Ikuko?
Who on Earth would believe that?
The cops might mount an investigation for good measure, but Gonzou will keep the truth well-hidden.
After seeing this report, Gonzou must have burned the threat letter.
“‘A disappointment to my fans!? Oh, is that what they're saying? Well, I'm sorry if that's the case. Just wait for my next performance!’”
At the end she covered the camera with her hand and cut the picture.
...This is bad.
‘Maou’ didn't make a move today.
The conflict between the Sonoyama Group and the Shin'ei Group ended this morning. I felt a streak of good fortune coming on, but I guess I jumped the gun a bit with that analysis.
The image of Kanon on the screen changed to something else.
It was the winner of this year's Grand Prix of Figure Skating, Seta Makiko.
“‘Well, um... it's really, really been a tough year for me... as you know, I let everyone down at Worlds earlier this year... but, uh...’”
She took a moment to cry, overcome with emotion.
Seta gave a solid performance today, and jumped from her fourth place spot after the short program to first place.
“‘I'm really, really thankful for everything today... that's all I want to say...’”
She showed no sign of acting solely for the television.
She gave off nothing but a brave and hard-working aura.
The contrast between these two girls will be great for the media.
Kanon's coach, Hilton, refused to comment on her performance today.
Why, then, did Ikuko come out and speak shamelessly?
“‘...Murder me...? No, no, no... no such thing has ever come up at all... right, well, uh... I was just making a little joke...’”
This worried me.
“‘Yes. I would like to apologize to everyone here on Kanon's behalf.’”
She bowed down her head and apologized to everyone honestly. It's what she's gotten used to doing.
But the fact that she added, ‘on Kanon's behalf,’ annoyed me... because I knew the truth.
I received a call at that moment.
“Hey, Kyousuke!”
“What!? I'm in a bad mood!”
“Don't piss on me, ass wipe! What the fuck happened today!?”
“I DON'T FUCKING KNOW!”
“People are talking so much shit about Kanon online! They started tacking w's onto Kanon's name, ‘Kanon-samawwwww...!’ You know what the fuck that means, Bro!?”
“More or less. Shit, Eiichi... this is bad news, man.”
“And what was with the pathetic excuse!? An assassination attempt!? This isn't Golgo 13! Think up something better next time!!”
“I know, right? Look, I gotta go.”
“Whatever. Just tell the little shit she better win the Japan Championships, alright!?”
...Ah, fucking hell!
I had totally forgotten. Eiichi's saying that if Kanon wants to skate at Worlds, she needs to win the Japan Championships.
And since she lost the Grand Prix, she would have to beat the second place skater by a large point margin to feel secure in her position.
If she doesn't compete in the World Championships, she'll be ineligible come the next Winter Olympics.
Kanon has already reached her prime skating years, so the upcoming Japan Championships will decide her whole career.
The door squeaked in protest...
And the most talked-about girl in Japan entered my room.
“Hey there. You're pretty late.”
“Mm.”
“Did you eat dinner?”
“Not hungry.”
She pouted.
“What?”
Apparently she doesn't like my stare.
“......”
“......”
Kanon averted her eyes and headed for the bath.
A few short moments later, I heard the sound of running water.
Five minutes passed by. Ten minutes. The bathroom kept silent other than the sound of the shower running.
I heard sobs over the water every now and then.
The bathroom light never once turned on. Kanon must have been devastated.
I was shocked upon seeing Kanon walk out of the dark bathroom.
“What the heck, Kanon...!?”
“......”
“Put some clothes on! You'll catch a cold!”
Her long, wet hair clung to her hips.
Water droplets glided against her full figure.
With a tormented face, she looked at me like a ghost.
“...Do you...”
Her voice was hoarse.
“Do you hate me?”
“Do you hate Non-chan too, Nii-san?”
I appeased her with a shake of my head.
“Do you think I'm a liar?”
“Everything I said was true...”
“She really did tell me that someone was gonna murder her...”
Fragile.
That skating star on the ice had vanished.
“That was why I fell...”
“That was why I lost...”
“I can't think of any reason... except that...”
“Please believe me... Nii-san...”
Only a desperate, love-starved girl stood before me.
“Everyone... everyone's just using Non-chan...”
“Mom is for fame...”
“Dad is for money...”
“The media, the sponsors, everyone... everyone, everyone... all the time... every day...”
Two thin lips continued to move silently.
“Who am I...?”
Like a robot doll with a loose screw, she talked more and more slowly.
“......P-pl-...”
She spoke in a soulless, broken manner, but I understood her.
‘Please save me...’
‘Surely there's some gentle person out there, someone who can warm my heart.’
I saw my past self in her.
When I was frozen, in a broken house far in the north, I had wished for the same.
“Nii-san...”
I know. My emotions for Kanon are more pity than love.
And pitiful it is.
I'm among those godless fiends who use Kanon.
But in the end, Kanon has no choice but to rely on us heretics.
And devils can save people, too.
Just like that snowy night, when Gonzou saved me.
There are people out there who can't wait for providence to extend a holy savior's hand.
I thought over what I was about to do.
...Even heretics have some pride.
Very well. I've decided to take responsibility.
I answered Kanon's request by reaching for her cold skin.
......
...
...
......
“So I was playing a galge yesterday, right?”
Eiichi suddenly started a conversation the next morning.
He was going on about some uninteresting junk, but I guess it'll do as a time-killer until class starts.
“Galge... that's one of those games where you hit on girls, right?”
“Yeah, the goal is to tap every sweet, 2D ass you come across.”
“Really, now...? Did you manage to sex anyone up yet?”
“Nah, not yet. That's not my point, though. I realized something yesterday that pissed me off.”
“What was it?”
“The protag, he's kinda like you.”
“Kinda like me how...?”
“He's sarcastic, and a bit of a dick, but then he whips out this strong sense of honor when the situation calls for it.”
“Oh?”
That's not like me at all.
“Oh yeah, and he's got this friend, too.”
“Friend?”
“He's real sexy and all, but he's always acting like an idiot. He helps out the protag sometimes when the shit hits the fan.”
“Oh?”
“Ain't he like me?”
“Uhm...”
“It's almost like he was modeled after me.”
“I'm not so sure about that...”
We banter for a few minutes until someone calls out to me.
“M-morning...”
“......”
“W-what...? Is... is there something wrong with me greeting you?”
“N-no...”
“...Are you free during lunch?”
“...I've got no plans, if that's what you mean. We can meet up if you want to.”
“Then I'll see you then.”
She briskly walked away.
“You killin' me, Kyousuke-chan.”
He drew closer to me with a jealous scowl.
“What was that about? You talk up a good revenge, then act like a little whipped bitch. What's going on with you two?”
“...Nothing's ‘going on’ between us...”
“Then what are you doing eating lunch with the enemy?”
“...Hey, what's the big deal?”
“You little shit... if this was a galge, you'd have fucked her twice by now.”
“Good thing this is reality, then.”
“Reality my ass. Didn't you get the memo? The world we live in is a virtual reality. Everything is just a computer simulation.”
“Right... so, you're saying that someone is out there right now, on the other side, watching our conversation?”
“Yeah, though I wish they'd hurry up and patch us. Someone needs to make a mod where I'm six feet tall.”
“You watch too many movies.”
Tokita meandered into the classroom before the bell rang.
“Yo. Not late today, huh?”
“Right, because I didn't sleep.”
“Up all night giving Shiratori weird ideas again?”
“Huh? Why would you think that? Did she invite you for lunch?”
...As I thought.
“Hey, Tokita.”
“What are you going all stiff about?”
“What are you to Shiratori?”
“Her sister, of course.”
“You have different mothers, don't you?”
“What's your point?”
“Weren't you and your mother thrown out of the Shiratori house?”
“Yeah, my mom was Director Shiratori's mistress. And as you can imagine, having a mistress live openly in the same house with the family might cause a problem or two. Before long, every day had turned into an episode of some late-night TV drama.”
“...I'm surprised you can talk about it so casually.”
“Is that strange?”
“Yes. You act like you're Shiratori's guardian, yet you were chased out of your own home while she stayed behind.”
“...Right, so?”
“One would expect you to envy or resent her.”
Tokita narrowed her eyes at that.
“Of course I envy her.”
She returned to speaking casually.
“But I've yet to be driven far enough to take my envy out on anyone.”
“I can't figure out how you manage to be so open and frank.”
“If I throw in a little drama, will you sympathize with me?”
“Not really...”
“Of course you wouldn't. And that's not particular to you; no one would. Even if people were aware of the horrible lives we faced day in, day out, or that we had been thrown out of our very home, no one would pity me.”
“I think that's a bit of an overstatement...”
“What would you do if I told you I was swindled yesterday?”
“I'd ask why.”
“There's no reason behind it, I was just tricked.”
“Then it might have been your fault.”
“That's right. That's not a cold response, either. It's merely human. People don't lend their hearts to those who do nothing but complain about their misfortunes.”
“Well, but that doesn't stop people from trying. Plenty of people out there just beg for sympathy by talking about their rough lives...”
“It has the opposite effect. People generally believe that the world is just. It's unsettling to think that misery can be doled out to saints as easily as sinners. Thus, people cope with this by assuming those who have led miserable lives have done something to deserve it.”
...What kind of life has this woman led?
I'd ask, but it doesn't look like she'd be willing to talk about it.
I obviously can't be certain, but it seems Tokita is doting on Shiratori after suffering through some complicated issue in the past.
“Hehe... well then, I wonder how Mizuha will fare today...?”
She smiled in delight.
Never mind. This can't be just doting on a sister...
Soon enough, it was lunchtime.
“...Do you bring your lunch, Azai-kun?”
“Nah, I always buy from the cafeteria.”
“Then... would you like some of this?”
“Some of what?”
“...I'd be too embarrassed to show you here... come with me.”
Where is she dragging me this time, for God's sake...?
I followed after Shiratori.
As she walked in front of me, I noticed that she held what looked to be a boxed lunch.
“I never thought I'd be eating lunch with you...”
And alone, no less.
“If you didn't want to, you should have said so.”
“I don't have much else to do.”
I ended her nagging by sitting down.
“...First, I want to say... sorry for yesterday.”
“Well, good. I half-thought you'd gone apeshit on me.”
“Nee-san told me that, um... you feel bad about the chocolates. Is that right?”
“...Yeah, I guess.”
“Then it's alright, I suppose. I forgive you.”
She was acting more than a touch condescending, but there was no reason to tell her that.
“I... made this...”
She babbled and held out the lunch.
“Eat it... oh, but only if you want to...”
“......”
“It's my apology... for yesterday...”
“......”
“I'll bet it tastes good. I'm good at cooking.”
Who said there was no such thing as a free lunch...?
“Alright, gladly.”
I unwrapped the napkin around the lunch to discover a cutesy little lunchbox.
I opened the lid, and cliché dishes like omelets and sausages were housed within.
“Is it good?”
“I haven't even taken a bite yet!”
What's got ants in her pants...?
I picked up the chopsticks inside the box and threw a bite of the food into my mouth.
...Well, it was fairly average.
Shiratori fixedly watched me.
“Oh yeah, I forgot you were rich. Is food like this too common for your tastes?”
“Don't be so fussy. It'll do just fine.”
“Phew.”
Still, it's hard to relax with Shiratori glaring at me.
There's something I need to confirm.
“Can I ask you something...?”
I put down the chopsticks.
“Do you have a thing for me?”
“......”
Shiratori bit her lips and went silent.
“Oh, did I misinterpret something?”
“......”
“I understand you gave me chocolates two years ago. Did you at least like me back then?”
Her trembling lips eventually spoke up.
“...Yeah.”
“Why?”
“Because you always looked kind.”
“Which part of me were you looking at?”
“You carried me to the school infirmary.”
I don't remember that at all.
“You used to talk to me in the morning a lot.”
I don't remember that either.
“You even chased off a few intimidating men who were harassing me.”
I remember that, though...
Those ‘intimidating men’ she spoke of were Sonoyama street thugs... boys at the bottom of the ladder.
I heard someone shout the name of the Sonoyama Group as I walked downtown, and lo and behold, they were belligerently complaining about Shiratori bumping into them.
I was with Gonzou at the time.
They had been too quick to flaunt the ‘family’, as those of the lowest rung are apt to do.
He ordered me to do something about them, so I ended up saving her by some strange coincidence...
“I think I finally get it. After that incident, you discovered my intentions behind everything, and have been angry at me ever since. Is that the gist?”
“Yeah. You only talked to me to get to my father, right?”
“Yeah, that's right.”
“...I see.”
She seemed to have taken another shock.
“But as it stands now, I have no intentions of getting involved with Director Shiratori. I don't need to explain that one, do I?”
“...I guess not...”
Between the hostage crisis and his bribery scandal, Director Shiratori is just about toast.
“Anyway, thanks for the meal.”
I handed the lunchbox back to her.
“...Was it good?”
“I'd put it at about average. Nothing really stood out as fantastic.”
“......”
She went silent again.
“Um...”
“Hm?”
“I lied when I said I was good at cooking. I'm sorry.”
“Really...? Well, it's no big deal... but why were you trying to show off?”
“Because, um... Nee-s-... n-no reason...”
“What did Tokita do this time?”
“She said if I did, I'd realize how honest you were.”
“...Honest?”
“She told me that if you just flattered me, then it would prove that you only want something from me... but she also said she didn't think that would be the case.”
“What kind of test was that?”
“It's just something I wanted to clear up.”
...So, Shiratori wants to trust me?
“I'm sorry, really. I shouldn't have tested you like that.”
“I don't mind. I'm used to being evaluated.”
“Th-that's pretty cool...”
“Wha-!?”
She suddenly blushed.
“Nee-san said that, um... that everyone has two faces. The trick is, apparently two is pretty much the limit. She told me that once you see their other face, if they still don't lie, then they're probably a trustworthy person.”
“Trustworthy? You think...?”
“A-anyway, I'll make you lunch tomorrow too...”
She left me with that as she ran off yet again.
“Ah, hey!”
Shiratori's figure, jogging off with tightly clenched fists, seemed rather... unfitting.
...Wait, tomorrow too?
And what was with that ‘that's pretty cool’?
“Hello.”
Tokita abruptly showed up.
“Goddammit! You scared the shit out of me!”
“Do you need an explanation?”
“Alright, look, what's up with Shiratori? Ever since you showed up, she's been acting weird. Has she gone mad or something?”
“I've got her completely brainwashed.”
“She even said I was cool... what the hell's wrong with her?”
Tokita laughed, grinning.
“The girl is a princess. Naturally, that means she likes tough, bad boys.”
“Bad boys...?”
“Did you even realize that your voice gets deeper when you show your true self? Supposedly that gets Mizuha's pulse up, if you know what I mean.”
“I hope I do, anyway.”
“Then let me make myself more clear: if you like it, eat it up. Naturally, I'm not referring to her cute little homemade lunch.”
...She sounds like an old lech.
Lunch break came to an end.
“Kyousuke, you free? I know you're free, who'm I kidding? Let's go to the arcade or something.”
“I don't go to arcades. You know that by now.”
“Then let's go grab some ramen or something.”
I've no plans for today...
“Nah, I'll pass. Not this time.”
“...Why the hell not?”
He suddenly started pouting.
“It's not Shiratori, is it?”
“Enough with the tasteless jokes.”
“You ate lunch with her though, didn't you? Just the two of you.”
“Look, that was... you know, it's all part of the revenge.”
“Oh...? You're still doing that?”
“Later.”
I turned my back to Eiichi.
“You're a cold bastard, you know that? It's not like you've got anything to do.”
“I'm just not in the mood.”
“That's exactly the time to go out and play, get your spirits up a little.”
He clears his throat and puts his chin up in the air.
“I know exactly the pick-me-up you need!”
“...You do?”
My interest is a little piqued, I must say.
“One-on-one soccer.”
So much for the ‘pick-me-up’. That was more like a ‘drop-me-down’.
“What's with the reluctant face?”
“So, basically, you're still just trying to get me to play games?”
How many times do I have to tell him I don't like them?
“Nah man, I'm talking real soccer here.”
“One of us kicks and the other is the goalkeeper? Like penalty kicks, or something?”
“Both of us kick.”
“Then the goal is empty!”
Just one wrong move and the other would score.
“Are we done here?”
“You really are a cold bastard.”
“Welp, see ya later!”
“Yeah, scurry on home, you cold piece of shit.”
That was a little harsh.
“Hey, Usami-san...”
Eiichi called out to Usami, who was on cleaning duty.
Most of the journalists and reporters who had plagued the school over the past few days must have given up, as only a few showed up today.
There were two groups of girls walking in front of me.
They walked past the school gate, then as if suddenly noticing something gossip-worthy, huddled up to whisper to each other.
I looked in the direction they were staring at... and Shiratori was standing there waiting.
“A-Azai-kun...”
I was hoping to ignore her and save myself from being dragged into that spectacle, but those hopes were shattered when she called out to me.
“Yo. You'll be stared at if you loiter around here.”
“Yeah, but... I wanted to ask you a favor.”
She was relentlessly pushy, just like at lunch.
“I wanted to ask you to, to... to walk home with me...”
That's it. I'm going to have to set her straight, once and for all...
“Alright... let's go to a cafe or something.”
“Ah, sure...”
She looked down again in embarrassment.
I asked the waiter for a table for two, and we sat down.
“......”
She seems nervous, as she won't even look me in the eyes.
“...You didn't have any important business with me or anything, did you?”
“...Not really. Is this a bother?”
I took a sip of my water before replying.
“I'll say this outright.”
I stare at her, and she shrinks into her shoulders in fear.
“I'm not interested in you in that way. In fact, I'm not really interested in you at all.”
“...I know.”
Even though she knew, she still seems disappointed.
“So... does that mean it's really no use...?”
She glanced at me with upturned eyes.
“Jesus, I don't understand you. There are plenty of better guys out there...”
What kind of girl likes the same guy over two of the most emotionally confused years of her life...?
“Your reason for falling for me is so cliché. To top that off, you discovered shortly thereafter that it was all a big lie. So why are you still clinging to me?”
Shiratori didn't answer.
“Are you just being stubborn?”
“...I don't know... but I can't help it.”
She bit her lip.
I couldn't understand Shiratori's feelings at all.
“...I'm kind of unsociable, and I'm lacking in a lot of ways... but I wanted you to get to know me a little better, to see beyond those things...”
She suddenly looked up, as if she had thought of something.
“Please. You won't lose anything by going out with me, and I won't get in your way.”
We can likely thank Tokita's influence for this pushiness.
...Then again...
“If you want to date me, go right ahead.”
“Huh?”
“You're good for a free screw and a mediocre lunch every now and then, at the very least.”
That single sentence seemed to pierce her chest.
“I'll date you because there's nothing to lose by fucking you. But like I said, I'm not interested in you. Are you still okay with that?”
I stood up to leave, not expecting a response.
“...!”
A sob of agony poured out.
“Later.”
I walked out before she could start crying.
...
......
I don't know much about love.
It's probably just another one of those ways to push your feelings onto someone else.
Well, whatever. I'm sure I'll forget all about this soon anyway.
I decided to take a shortcut, and turned into a narrow alley.
“Yo yo yo!”
“Hehehe!”
The voices of bandits spilled forth from the darkness.
“Usami-san, the line!”
“Hehehe, if you want to pass, leave your water and food.”
“Usami-san, wrong line.”
“Oops. What was it again?”
“Never mind... listen, shithead! Prepare to meet your doom!”
“Uwa!”
“Ouch! What the hell are you doing?”
“That's my line. What were you doing just now?”
“...Nothing?”
“Huh!?”
“H- get your face away from me...!”
“I'm asking what you were doing after you refused to go get ramen with me!”
“Wh-what are you talking about!?”
“Oh!? Playing dumb, now!?”
“Gah, l-let me go...!”
“We were following you all along. Right, Usami-san?”
“Ah, yes.”
“So there you have it. You went into the cafe with Shiratori. How are you gonna talk your way out of this one?”
...I could just be honest and say Shiratori confessed to me, at which point I refused, but...
“......”
“I'll leave it to your imagination.”
getting ready to wet your dipstick!”
“......”
“‘Revenge’ my ass! You've pissed us off good this time, right Usami-san?”
“Ah, yes.”
“Dammit! I'm not gonna let you take all the good bits!”
He flipped me the bird and walked off.
“You better watch your back when you walk the streets at night, you... CUNTING GALGE PROTAG!”
Usami still stood there, staring fixedly at me.
“Azai-san, is it true?”
“...What do you think? Of course not.”
“...Oh?”
She hung her head as if thinking about something.
“...How is Gonzou-san these days? Has he said anything about ‘Maou’?”
“What's with the sudden interrogation? No, he hasn't said anything.”
“I see... I thought ‘Maou’ might have been the one pulling the strings behind the other day's hostage crisis... I guess it was my imagination.”
She looked up, and stared straight at me again.
“Well, then... bye.”
“...Uh, yeah...”
Usami walked off.
For some reason, I gazed at her back.
Something about that tone didn't sound like a normal ‘bye’.
“Weird woman...”
I headed home.
After calling Miki-chan, Gonzou, and a few other business associates, I laid down on my bed.
I thought back on the day.
Most of my thoughts are obviously centered on Shiratori.
...She wants me to be her boyfriend.
‘To be a boyfriend...’
I can't say I fully understand the meaning of that phrase.
Does it mean ‘to fall in love with someone, and become emotionally involved’?
It may even include ‘to take the steps necessary to become a husband and father’――well, there aren't many people who think that far ahead, so I'd wager that's not part of its popular use.
But either way, people date because it has some merit for them.
Be it because they're aiming for their partner's assets, or to fulfill their own desires... there's something they're getting out of it.
So, if I was to date Shiratori, there would have to be some merit in it for me.
What is there to gain from dating Shiratori...?
Naturally, it would have to be something only Shiratori could provide.
“...Hm.”
This train of thought is incredibly out of character, and frankly, stupid.
It's vain to try to explain something as intangible and abstract as emotion with logic. Of course, that doesn't stop Tokita from having a blast doing just that.
My cell phone loudly rang.
I somehow predicted who it would be.
“...Evening, are you fine for time right now?”
“Yeah... I gotta say, I'm surprised. I thought our conversation was finished, was it not?”
“Nee-san gave me the courage to try again...”
That damn ‘Nee-san’ again, huh...?
Shiratori apparently can't do anything without Tokita...
“Um... I want to pick up where we left off at the cafe...”
“I don't think there's much left to say.”
“...Uh... ummm...”
She's a timid girl when Tokita isn't pushing her around.
“What? Are you going to ask me out again?”
“...Hn...”
“I told you already. We can do whatever you want, but I'll only be using you.”
She eventually spoke up in a sobbing voice.
“...Okay!”
“Come again?”
“That... that's okay...!”
The sadist in me reared its ugly head.
“I might cheat on you, or ask you for money.”
I couldn't fathom this situation.
What does Shiratori have to gain that could push her this far?
“I don't mind...!”
Shiratori was blind.
I remember Tokita once telling me that Shiratori was no good with people...
I was honestly taken aback by Shiratori's absurd request.
“Alright... fair enough, then let's date...”
I involuntarily agreed.
If I play around with her a little, she might open her eyes.
“R-really?”
“Sure.”
“Th-thank you...!”
“You promised not to get in my way. You'd do best to remember that.”
“...I know... ask me anything... I'll do whatever you want!”
“What's with you...?”
My interest in Shiratori suddenly spiked.
“I'm hanging up. Try not to call me for no reason.”
“I know... I'll text you.”
“Whether I read it or not is my prerogative.”
“...That's fine.”
...How long is she going to keep this up?
Anyone else would have abandoned hope once they realized the other person didn't share their feelings.
“Well, good night...”
Her last words were somehow sad.
“......”
Whatever, just because I'm dating Shiratori doesn't mean my life is going to suddenly change tomorrow morning.
I guess I'll go to sleep...
......
...
　Mizuha hugged her older sister, weeping.
“...W-was that okay?”
“You did well.”
　She had always confidently encouraged Mizuha.
“B-but, he said he might cheat on me...”
“Really? That's so incredibly cruel. Keep in mind that's just his personality, though.”
“But it was so mean. I don't know if I can go on like that...”
　Mizuha just keeps whining, yet a gentle voice rains down upon her head.
“You only think that because you're not putting in enough effort.”
“Effort?”
“From now on, make sure to tell him exactly how you feel. Never give up.”
“Yeah... I'll try. Sorry for always whining.”
　Mizuha's sister laughed at her obedient attitude.
“As your relationship with him deepens, you'll stop whining so much. You'll stop needing my help, too. When that happens, you're near your goal.”
“Okay. Thanks...”
“Now, it's late.”
“Ah, wait, Nee-san. Let's walk back together until we have to split up.”
　Mizuha has her own home.[l] Yuki has her own family.[l] They're sisters, but they can't live together.
“Ah, it started snowing...”
“Oh?”
　Mizuha held her sister's hand.
“I hope we get to make snowmen again...”
“Yeah...”
　Yuki laughed.
　Mizuha failed to recognize the dark shadow lurking inside her grin.
The morning chill seemed a touch colder today.
Alright, I've got a full day ahead of me today, too.
Finishing up the preparations for the day, I walked to the door, [se storage=se_04 loop=true]only to have the cell in my chest pocket suddenly ring.
“Hello...”
It was Tsubaki.
“I'm really sorry about calling this early.”
“Ah, it's no problem. Has something happened?”
“Well, I'm going to deliver the ransom today.”
“Oh...”
I pretended to be surprised.
“That's a lot of pressure. Can you do it by yourself?”
“Yeah. This is the only thing that I can do.”
I sensed a steeled resolution in Tsubaki's voice.
“I'm sorry that I can't be with you at a time like this.”
“You've already done enough, Azai-kun.”
“Well, I still have work to do. I'll come right over after I'm finished.”
Yeah... after I'm finished.
“Thanks. I'll be waiting.”
I hung up and walked out the door.
Finally...
I couldn't contain my amusement, a smile tugged at my lips.
Let's enjoy this little game, shall we?
　Nine o'clock in the morning.
　Haru's mind was as clear as the winter sky.
“Alrighty then, Tsubaki. This time, let's use our powers of friendship to apprehend the culprit!”
“You seem ready and raring to go, Haru-chan.”
“Did you bring the ransom?”
“Yup.”
　Tsubaki was holding the certificates in an envelope, cradling it like a precious child.
　After waving to Tsubaki's parents, who had walked the pair to the door, the two of them left for Central Boulevard.
　Where did all these people come from?[l] Even at noon on Central Boulevard, this monstrous crowd is out of the ordinary.
“Hey, Haru-chan?”
“What?”
“Do you think it's okay for the two of us to go together?”
　Tsubaki's stride was getting heavier by the second.[l] Haru matched her footsteps, moving in tandem.
“He didn't say that we can't.”
　In fact, Haru was under the impression that ‘Maou’ was practically inviting her to participate in this incident.
“Still, I think it might be better if I keep my distance.”
　‘Maou’ had likely anticipated Haru's involvement.
　If so, then instead of delivering the ransom with Tsubaki, it would be better to try to hide and pounce on ‘Maou’ at the opportune moment.[l] For example, the best chance of nabbing ‘Maou’ might come when his attention is focused on Tsubaki during the exchange.
“What should we do?”
　Tsubaki asked.[l] She must still be worried about going alone.
“It'll be fine. I'm going to be right by your side.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, only I'll keep a reasonable distance and watch over you from afar.”
　Tsubaki tilted her head dubiously.
“Wait, does that mean we can't contact each other after this?”
“That's right.”
“I see...”
　Haru put her hand on Tsubaki's shoulder.
“If it ever looks like you're going to be in any trouble, I'll dash out and save you immediately.”
　That one sentence made Tsubaki relax, if only a little bit.[l] A hint of crimson flashed across her face, and she nodded.
“Let me say one last thing.”
“Sure, what?”
“I'll try with all my might to catch the kidnapper. However, if he evades me, I intend to focus on keeping the ransom.”
“...Really?”
　Tsubaki frowned again, apprehensive once more.[l] Tsubaki must still want to follow the instructions of the kidnapper and give him the ransom.
“Listen closely, Tsubaki. Even if the criminal escapes, as long as we still have the ransom, there's a chance there'll be another exchange... I think.”
　‘Maou’ will try to contact the family again in an attempt to get the ransom.[l] And after that, a second battle will ensue.
　This should be true... but a foreboding feeling wriggled about in Haru's gut.
　One can claim that Haru's speculations are appropriate, but they make the critical assumption that ‘Maou's’ goal is to get the ransom.[l] To the best of her knowledge, though, this crime wasn't committed by a person who needs money.
　――Just how much is fifty million yen in shares to ‘Maou’?
　Still, Haru remains stubbornly convinced that ‘Maou’ is just trying to provoke her.[l] In ‘Maou's’ eyes, it might be less of a challenge and more of a game.[l] Whatever the case, if ‘Maou’ intends to defeat Haru, she would simply have to beat him to the punch.[l] Of course, there's a chance that ‘Maou’ might kill Hiroaki-kun out of retaliation when he realizes his defeat.[l] Haru couldn't tear this unsettling thought from her mind...
“Haru-chan, I'll say what I said yesterday. Do what you want to do.”
“Thank you. I thought you'd say that.”
“Hehe.”
　Tsubaki stuck out her tongue.
“You're a really mysterious person, Haru-chan.”
“What's that supposed to mean?”
“You sorta seem like dead weight sometimes, but you're full of vigor at other times. Which one is the real you?”
“Who knows...?”
　To be looked into by another gave Haru a tingling feeling.
“Haru-chan, do you change schools often?”
“I guess...”
“Really? That must be exhausting.”
　As kind as she was, Tsubaki must have realized that Haru probably didn't have many friends.
“Hey, Tsubaki. Other people tend to call me disgusting.”
　Her words, seeming to come out of nowhere, shocked Tsubaki wide-eyed.
“If you think I'm disgusting too, you don't have to be friends with me, you know?”
　Haru thought of the past.[l] The past where she perpetually hid her loneliness behind a lone-wolf attitude and a cynical facade...
　However, Tsubaki's response was firm.
“Don't say such sad things.”
　Surprised, Haru looked at Tsubaki.
“You're my friend, Haru-chan!”
　Just why would such a pure girl exist in real life?
　Tsubaki's gaze was firm; charismatic, even.[l] Haru decided in the back of her mind to do everything in her power for Tsubaki, no matter what happened.[l] She couldn't understand the reason behind it, and Haru's confusion showed on her face.
“There's one last question I have to ask you.”
“What? I thought the last thing was the last...”
“This one really is the last, and it's an extremely important question.”
“Alright...”
　Haru fixed her gaze on Tsubaki.
“Tsubaki, do you like Azai-san?”
“Eh!?”
　Tsubaki obviously hadn't expected that, as she blushed red.
“Well, do you?”
“Tha-that's...”
“I'm asking whether you like him or not.”
“Y-yeah, I like him. Of course I like him. You can't find anyone as reliable as him.”
“Humph.”
“What do you mean, ‘Humph’?”
　So her first impression was correct.[l] Haru's emotions grew complicated.[l] On the contrary, Tsubaki's mind seemed to have already cleared up.
“We should talk more after Hiroaki comes back. There's so much to talk about.”
　Haru nodded.[l] This time, it was Tsubaki's words that helped Haru relax.
　After all, she had just gained an excellent friend...
　It was already 11:10.[l] Tsubaki glanced at the clock on Central Boulevard to double-check the time.
　After parting with Haru, she had been on her own, following the kidnapper's instructions by herself.[l] Almost right after the mall opened, she walked in.[l] Per the criminal's demands, she spent six thousand yen on a cheap attaché case.[l] The ransom, worth virtually everything the entire family owns, was already in that briefcase.
　Tsubaki dialed on the cell phone Haru gave her.[l] It was strong in both battery life and signal.
“Hello...?”
　The call connected quickly.[l] The kidnapper's captivating voice circled around her ear.
“You must be a model student, Tsubaki.”
“Pardon?”
“You prepared that briefcase in record time. The mall only opened at eleven.”
　She had no idea what he was talking about.[l] She had no choice but to rush with her brother's life on the line.
“I hope that you can be this quick from here on out.”
　Tsubaki could only give a faint response.
“Are you on Central Boulevard right now?”
“Yes...”
“Head to Central Business. Do you know that big park with a nice view of Sannou Corporation's headquarters?”
“Where am I supposed to be inside the park?”
“There's a big billboard, you can't miss it. Stand beside it, we'll meet there.”
“I understand...”
“Hurry.”
　The call was suddenly disconnected.
　Tsubaki stopped and looked around, searching for Haru.[l] However, sweeping her gaze through the bustling sea of people, she couldn't spot that attention-grabbing hair.
　――She should be following me right now...
　Tsubaki gripped her briefcase, cutting through the chaotic streets.
Thirty minutes, at the very most.
Twenty minutes should be enough time to reach the park from the department store on foot, even for a girl.
Even though I told Tsubaki that we would meet, I have no intentions of fulfilling that promise.
I need to confirm one thing before I take the ransom:
Whether or not the delivery person is truly obedient to the kidnapper.
In other words, I need to determine whether or not she has the sense of responsibility and the stamina required for a successful exchange...
...And, most importantly, whether or not she's contacted the police.
So... thirty minutes.
My gaze followed the minute hand on my watch.
I believe that if she's still not here within thirty minutes, then without a doubt the police will be coming with her.
If Tsubaki's family has ignored my warnings and called the police, there might be over a hundred officers watching Tsubaki deliver the ransom.
In order to capture me, countless police officers would have already begun setting an inescapable net at the park.
However, no matter how quickly the task force responds, doing so would still take a considerable amount of time.
After all, the police would have to move everyone from Central Boulevard to this park.
They wouldn't allow Tsubaki to proceed until they finished organizing their members.
That's why I'm being so sensitive to time.
If I don't spot Tsubaki within thirty minutes, I have no choice but to cancel the exchange.
“......”
Visibility in the park is excellent.
If there are undercover cops about, I might be able to spot them. However, I don't have the confidence to say that I could do so with absolute certainty.
For instance, if you were to ask me who stands out the most, there are two middle aged couples, a man walking a dog, a man who looks like he's on his way to the office, and an old man helping a pregnant woman... there are simply too many suspects.
Thus, the least I should do is remember the faces of everyone here.
That way, if a person with a familiar face shows up as I order Tsubaki around, I can determine with high confidence that the person is with the police.
I sat on a bench, scanning the area, searching for signs of law enforcement.
“...Hmm.”
I saw Tsubaki.
She was sprinting to the billboard with all her strength.
A girl wearing casual clothes and carrying an attaché case is very conspicuous.
If a person with an overactive imagination saw Tsubaki right now, they might think that she looks like she's running to deliver a ransom...
I checked the time.
It's been less than fifteen minutes since the last contact.
Well then, it's about time to issue the next order.
However, I need to act under the assumption that there are already undercover police searching the park.
If that is indeed the case, then I definitely can't call her immediately.
The moment Tsubaki picks up, they'll be searching the park frantically for anyone talking on a phone.
Before leaving, I took a second to look at Tsubaki in the distance.
Even from afar, I could see she was nervous.
　She waited for almost an hour.
　Tsubaki was nearly suffocating from the anxiety.[l] Even though she came to the appointed place, not a single person who seemed like the kidnapper has shown up.[l] The only people who have come to talk to her are flirtatious young men, not knowing anything about the situation.
　Her cell phone suddenly rang.[l] The kidnapper is calling.
“Yes, I'm here!”
　She yelled into the phone.[l] The kidnapper groaned in discontent.
“...You're too loud, Tsubaki.”
“Eh!?”
“Don't yell. Everyone around you will think you're suspicious, now won't they? Running around the city with an attaché case doesn't exactly match the image of a normal girl like yourself.”
“S-sorry...”
　The kidnapper's instructions are what made her stand out so badly, but she kept this thought to herself out of fear.
“Um, so... what should I do with the briefcase?”
“Keep a good grip on it.”
“Huh?”
“Change of plan. Let's change the exchange point.”
　Tsubaki was lost.[l] She searched for Haru without thinking, but she couldn't even find a thread of her being.
“Go to the station on Central Boulevard. There's a row of lockers near the entrance. Go and find the coin locker that's labeled ‘out of order.’”
“W-wait a second, please, I'm writing this down...”
　Lodging the cell between her head and shoulder, she used her free hands to open her diary.
“Put the briefcase, with the certificates inside, into the locker.”
“Isn't it broken?”
“Trust me, there's no problem with it at all.”
　The warning was probably prepared by him beforehand.[l] Tsubaki waited for her next instructions.
“After you lock it, take the key and get on the train to Sakuraougi City. That's where you'll be going next.”
“Sakuraougi City?”
　That's the final stop of the line, in the next prefecture.[l] From Central Boulevard, the trip will take two hours.[l] Just what is he planning to have me do, calling me out that far?
“When you get there, walk out of the train station, stand there, and wait.”
“Are you going to contact me again?”
“No, you'll phone me. Hurry.”
“I understand. We'll meet up there, right?”
“If you're a good girl, Tsubaki.”
　He used a frivolous tone.[l] He's probably just messing with her.[l] Tsubaki's unreleased emotions are rising and crashing inside her chest, waiting to explode at the lightest touch.
“I'll follow everything that you say, so please, return my brother to me.”
　Flames of anger began to swell within the girl.
　Yet even with Tsubaki in this state, the kidnapper spoke to her in a mocking tone.
“And what will you do if I don't?”
“I won't forgive you!”
　She herself was surprised at the strength and harshness in her words.
　An unbearable silence followed.
　Terror attacked her.[l] She may have angered the kidnapper.[l] An inappropriate provocation may bring disaster upon Hiroaki.[l] If that truly happened, how could she possibly endure the knowledge that she was responsible?
　The criminal spoke quietly.
“I've made a decision.”
“Huh?”
“I will mold you into a human.”
　His words only confused her.[l] Just as she was about to ask, the connection was cut.
　――Into a human?
　Does that have some kind of philosophical meaning?[l] She's never been good at understanding hidden meanings.[l] And besides, it's natural for her not to understand the ideas of an evildoer, of a man who kidnapped a child.
　She collected her feelings and walked to the station.
　As she was waiting for the light to change, someone spoke out to her.
“Tsubaki, don't move. Listen to me.”
　Tsubaki had no idea when she had appeared, but Haru was standing by her side.[l] She spoke to Tsubaki, keeping her eyes straight ahead rather than looking at her.
“Did you record all of his instructions?”
“Y-yeah. It's all in the diary.”
“Then rip that page out and quietly throw it away as you walk.”
“I understand...”
　The light turned green.[l] People began to surge forward.[l] Once she got to the other end of the crosswalk, Tsubaki looked back behind her.[l] Haru was already nowhere to be seen.
　Even now, Tsubaki had a sense of resistance to littering.[l] But when she realized Haru would pick it up immediately, she felt a little better about it.
Two hours and ten minutes have passed.
If one hurried, they should have been able to get from the park to Sakuraougi City in two hours.
If it takes Tsubaki any longer, there is again the possibility of police involvement.
I, of course, am still on Central Boulevard.
After finishing all my preparations, I sat in the backseat of the car and gazed at the scenery outside.
The populace ignored the cruelty of the winter's cold, and the street grew even livelier.
A panicked voice came through from the other end of the line.
“Hello!?”
“Are you there?”
“Yes! Where am I supposed to go next?”
“I hope you didn't lose the key.”
“I have it. What should I do next?”
I gave her the instruction decided upon a long time ago.
“Come back.”
“Pardon?”
Ignoring Tsubaki, who was in an utterly morbid state, I continued.
“Come back and retrieve the briefcase from the locker.”
“Wh-why?”
“There's no reason for me to explain.”
“But why did you have me come this far...?”
...To get the ransom, of course.
“Umm, are you still suspicious of the police?”
“...Who knows?”
“If that's how it is, then this is just a waste of time. I really didn't contact the police.”
It's clear from her voice that she would like nothing better than to just give me the ransom, right this second.
“There's no police involvement?”
“No, definitely not!”
There's a reason she had to go from Tomanbetsu to Sakuraougi City.
Police take their respective jurisdictions seriously.
If Tsubaki was being backed by the police, then this kidnapping investigation would have to be transferred to the other prefecture.
Thus, the arrangement of personnel would be put into into disorder once more.
Such an event would considerably hinder police mobilization in this prefecture.
Of course, there is a chance that the police departments have made contact previously and are working together.
However, police are people who are very conscious of territory, if not quite at a yakuza level.
According to my judgment, the police of Tomanbetsu and Sakuraougi City won't rally together just for a kidnapping incident.
...Still, it's a good thing I didn't send her to Tokyo.
That was my original plan.
I never would have guessed that this prefecture and the Tokyo police department keep an unexpectedly good relationship. I only found this out a short while ago...
That was dangerous.
“Fine, I will believe you.”
Tsubaki's actions are swift, without hesitation.
At the very least, she shouldn't have had time to be in close contact with the police.
“Next time, I promise. Next time, I will retrieve the ransom.”
I was finally confident that I had done enough to preclude the police's involvement and continue on with this battle.
“So, after I pick up the briefcase, where should I go?”
“Take the subway to the residential area in the Southern District.”
“Okay.”
“I'm going to give you the address you need to go to.”
Tsubaki confirmed the address after I told her the details.
“A white car will be parked there. Its door will be unlocked. Take the ransom and sit in the back seat.”
“What should I do after that?”
“Wait for me to arrive.”
“What...?”
“Are you uneasy? Does the thought of being in a cramped car alone with me frighten you?”
I laughed coldly.
“Wh-what are you planning?”
“I was hoping to go for a ride...”
“......”
I'm really looking forward to it...
I hung up and commanded the driver to go.
　After another two hours or so, Tsubaki stepped back onto Central Boulevard.[l] The sun sets early in winter.[l] It was already evening by the time she arrived at the Southern District.
“Hey, Tsubaki.”
　It was Haru.[l] She had suddenly appeared behind Tsubaki, calling her name.[l] Haru spoke abruptly.
“When you left for Sakuraougi City, I kept watch on the locker. No one approached the locker or tried to open it.”
“I see...”
　She didn't go with me to Sakuraougi City.
“I didn't know whether to follow you or look after the locker... after thinking a bit, I picked the latter. Basically, even if he got the key, he still had to come to the locker if he wanted the ransom.”
　Haru's explanation was more than enough to wipe away the anxiety in Tsubaki's heart.
“If only there were more people to help us...”
　Haru said these words with a hint of loneliness.[l] The moment she finished, she once again disappeared into the sea of people.
　Tsubaki felt an ache in her heart.[l] Maybe Haru doesn't even have a single friend that she can rely on...
　Without thinking, she murmured.
“Azai-kun...”
　If Kyousuke were with me, I'm certain I'd have all the courage I needed.
　Tsubaki savagely whipped her weak heart for that sentiment.[l] Wishing for unobtainable things won't bring her brother back to her.[l] Her grip on the briefcase tightened as she headed toward the Southern District.
　She had no idea why she called out Kyousuke's name.
　Tsubaki has pretty much never been there before, and the Southern District is, as a whole, a very quiet residential area.[l] The setting sun has dyed the newly-built Western houses and the metal fences surrounding them a bloody red.
　Tsubaki checked the address again as she searched for her destination.
“Found it...”
　She saw the car.[l] It was your everyday white sedan.[l] Tsubaki didn't know what the kidnapper's car would be like; thankfully, there was only one white car at the designated place.
　――Sit in the backseat...
　Her heartbeat grew violent.[l] She had never dreamed she'd be going on a ride with the kidnapper.[l] He might even hold her captive.[l] Nevertheless, in the end, she still wanted her brother to be released.[l] And for Hiroaki, sacrificing herself would be an easy price to pay.
　Tsubaki walked closer to the car, trembling as she rounded the bumper.[l] Hesitantly, she forced herself to peer through the window.[l] There was no one inside.
　She decisively reached for the door handle.
　Tsubaki slid into the backseat.[l] She put the briefcase containing the ransom on her knee, letting a deep breath flow from her lips to calm herself.
　Silence reigned.[l] The car was almost completely devoid of sound.[l] Small beads of sweat soaked through her palm.[l] The only noise that reached her ears was her own heartbeat.
　The silence only made her wait more torturous.
　She was being tortured by anxiety.[l] The moment she closed her eyes, Hiroaki's face floated before her.[l] Where is he right now?[l] Is he eating well?[l] I just want to hurry up and see him.
　Hearing the ring of her cell, Tsubaki instinctively opened her eyes.[l] She retrieved the cell from her pocket in a panic.
“Is it comfortable inside the car?”
　It was the kidnapper.
“I'm very sorry that I had to resort to a cheap vehicle like that, especially on such a rare occasion.”
　She didn't understand him.[l] What does it matter how much the car costs?[l] Tsubaki had read in a book before that men put great focus on appearances; to her, it was something incomprehensible.
“...Um, when will you be here?”
“I'm on my way...”
　However, at that instant...
“Hmm...?”
　...the kidnapper suddenly lowered his voice.
“What's this?”
　His voice changed.[l] It lost the ease it once held.
“Wh-what's wrong?”
　Her question wasn't answered.
　After a brief silence, the call was disconnected.
“Huh...?”
　Yet another unexpected event was hurled toward Tsubaki, still confused by the kidnapper's last words.
　Someone rapped on the car window.[l] Following the sound, there was a face Tsubaki had never seen before.[l] It stared her down emotionlessly.
　A hat and uniform.[l] She trembled.[l] Her jaw hung wide open.[l] The one thing that criminals fear the most stood just beyond the car window.
　――Police!
　Tsubaki sank into terror, having no idea what she should do about the sudden appearance of the police.
　Her knees were shaking.[l] The police officer was asking her to get out.[l] Her vision was hazy, dizziness gnawed at her, and her stomach lurched with every motion.[l] Tsubaki stepped out like a mindless robot.[l] When she opened the door, she put the briefcase down on the seat almost subconsciously.
　The man was repeating a question that she didn't know how to answer.
　Does this car belong to you――?
　Tsubaki was more nervous than she had ever been in her life as she listened to the policeman's questions like an uninvolved bystander.
　What are you doing here――?
　Tsubaki shook her head, making meaningless sounds such as ‘ah’ and ‘eh’.[l] She thought she managed to reply that everything was fine.[l] However, the policeman kept on saying, ‘This is standard procedure, just answer.’[l] They also mentioned something about the possibility of the car being stolen, and other things along that line.
　She was completely incoherent.[l] She had never been spoken to by a police officer before.[l] She almost wet herself from fear.[l] If the kidnapper saw her with the police, how would she explain?
　There are two of them.[l] There are also two bicycles.[l] But those are only fleeting images before her eyes.
　What's that briefcase――?
　One policeman pointed to the car behind her.
　Can we check inside it――?
　That question jerked her slightly back to her senses.[l] A strange sense of purpose began to take hold of her.
“N-no, you can't...”
　It was as soft as the buzz of a mosquito.[l] Even though her head was lowered, she clearly demonstrated her rejection.
　She didn't know when it happened, but the policeman in front of her was holding a briefcase.
“I said no!”
　It was the briefcase with the ransom inside.[l] The briefcase containing her brother's life.[l] If they looked through it, the police would know about the kidnapping.[l] When this train of thought surged through her mind, fear that she'd never be able to see her brother again rushed toward her.
　That fear purged all reason, and Tsubaki lost track of her own actions.
　A freakish scream burst forth into the air.[l] She reached out her hands and grabbed something as tightly as she could.[l] Her fingertips felt the cool, hard shell of the briefcase.[l] The policeman said something, but Tsubaki never heard a word.[l] She was running.[l] She was facing away from the policemen.[l] A yell for her to stop may have reached her back, but not her brain.[l] Fear.[l] Yet her legs, as if they didn't belong to her but some other animal, kept on sprinting.
　She ran away; wordless, panting, dizzy, almost falling down.[l] She felt as if she too had become a criminal.[l] Driven by the guilt and oxygen deprivation, her tears couldn't be stopped anymore.
　But there was no time for her to cry anymore.
“Ah, oh God, I'm sorry!”
　Having successfully escaped and now making her way through the bustling crowd of Central Boulevard, Tsubaki was still on edge.
“I'm sorry, but I managed to get away. I still have the ransom!”
　She begged with all that she had.[l] The kidnapper answered with a voice colder than those she had heard before.
“Why do you apologize? Wasn't that a coincidence?”
“It was. I swear, I had no idea. How could I have known that there would be police?”
“If you had no idea, then why are you apologizing? I can't fathom why you would do that unless you have been in contact with the police all along.”
“I, um... I just thought I should...”
　The person on the other end of the line didn't let down his guard.
“Did you betray me?”
“N-no!”
“You were thinking that you would catch me there, weren't you?”
“It's true, believe me!”
“Forget about it, this exchange is over.”
“How can you do that!?”
　She felt as if her head had just been struck by a blunt object.[l] If this continues, Hiroaki is gone...
“I'll do anything! I'll do anything, just please let my brother go!”
“......”
“Please, please...!”
　By the end of her pleading, she was unable to even form sentences.[l] Her eyes were filled with tears.
“You really treasure your brother this much?”
“...Of course.”
“Why?”
“Because we're family...”
　At that, the kidnapper laughed coldly.
“Yes, of course. Because you're family. Right, a person should treasure family.”
　He continued with a mocking tone.
“Tsubaki, you must have been loved since birth. Probably raised clean and pure, too.”
“Wh-what does that mean?”
“Exactly what it sounds like. The kindness radiating from you is just too dazzling. I can hardly bear to look at it.”
　Tsubaki understood that comment even less.[l] Everyone always says she's a good person.[l] Kyousuke had even joked about it.[l] But isn't everyone else good too...?
“I've always thought that kindness is malicious intent in disguise, but it seems like you're an exception.”
　She just couldn't take it anymore.
“Umm...”
“Fine. We'll continue the exchange.”
“Th-thank you so much!”
　She lowered her head in thanks without thinking about it.[l] Even in this outrageous situation, she still showed her gratitude to the criminal.
“I'm going to be more careful from now on. Even if the police interfere, I will follow through with my plans and take the ransom.”
　Tsubaki was beginning to think that the kidnapper is still human after all.[l] As long as she just asks him with sincerity, he'll understand.[l] He might even have a good reason for kidnapping Hiroaki.
　For the first time, Tsubaki found herself interested in the kidnapper's thoughts and feelings.[l] So interested, in fact, that she completely missed the point when she had stopped asking questions; the point when she became completely obedient.
The sun has set.
The young winter wind carries a chill.
I lean on a railing, continuing my conversation with Tsubaki.
After that exchange, I had Tsubaki go to the Western District and a nearby city, there and back.
The forms of transportation included walking, cable car, taxi, and other methods.
As promised, everything was done with utmost care.
The area in the Southern District is already in an uproar over Tsubaki.
A girl holding an attaché case is always very conspicuous.
With someone that suspicious, there's always the possibility that an upstanding citizen might report her.
And one can't say that police won't connect a suspicious person with a kidnapping.
Still, it would be practically impossible for the police both to become certain that the suspicious person is Tsubaki and to find out that she's the victim of a kidnapping all within a single day.
I will retrieve the ransom today.
I've left no evidence behind.
That white car was stolen anyway.
Its disposal has already been prepared. It'll be no more than a piece of scrap metal in a factory in another prefecture by morning.
If one was worried about the police finding some trace evidence from the car, then his time would be better spent worrying about the possibility of a catastrophic eruption of Mount Fuji happening at exactly noon tomorrow.
“......”
Almost everything is prepared.
The only thing left is Usami.
She seemed to have been trailing Tsubaki, only keeping her distance.
Even though I had been watching for Usami as I kept track of Tsubaki, I couldn't find her at all.
That freakish hair is completely unfit for following people, but that may be where the blind spot is.
With hair that long, changing hairstyles is a snap.
With a hat and glasses, she could become a different person in an instant.
Yet, in the end, I will be the one to take the ransom.
In the meantime, I'll have them run around and waste their strength.
“......”
Another headache attacked me, but this time, I must endure it.
I can't surrender to the headache right now.
A depression was fiercely burning inside me, igniting my will to fight.
...I won't let you interfere. Neither you, Azai, nor Usami...
　――Come on out, ‘Maou’.
　It's already around eight o'clock.[l] Haru had been running here and there, all across the city, since before noon.[l] Now, after nightfall, she has returned to the park in the Eastern District.[l] Haru hid herself in the grass, not making a single sound for fear of being heard over the silence of her surroundings.[l] This park is a place where people come to relax during the day, but at night, only an eerie quiet remains.
　She wondered how Tsubaki was holding up after all this walking.[l] Before coming to the park, Tsubaki had been told to lock the briefcase in the locker again.[l] Taking only the key, she came to a garbage can in the park.
　Haru didn't even glance at the locker this time around, and chose to follow Tsubaki instead.[l] If someone wanted to get the ransom, they must get closer to the locker, and to open the locker, they would need the key.
　And there's even someone watching the locker.[l] Haru had run into Kyousuke on Central Boulevard.[l] After she explained things, Kyousuke was more than happy to help.[l] Even though he said he was helping his father, he had a surprising amount of free time.
　Tsubaki's cell phone rang.[l] Haru concentrated on the noises around her.[l] It would be bad if she showed her face now.[l] She could only follow the situation through sound.
“Yes... I understand...”
　Tsubaki's exhaustion made itself apparent in her voice.[l] It's understandable.[l] She's been in a state of heightened anxiety all day.[l] She had almost fainted when the police had showed up.
“So I should just throw the key in the garbage can?”
　She didn't know whether or not Tsubaki was doing it on purpose, but Tsubaki had repeated the kidnapper's instructions.
“...I understand. I'm on my way.”
　As Tsubaki finished the conversation, Haru heard the sound of a cell phone closing.[l] Footsteps followed...[l] As the footfalls grew quieter, it seemed that Tsubaki had left the area.
　Haru remained still, curling her body into a ball.[l] If she just stayed there, ‘Maou’ would definitely come to retrieve the key...
　――No, that's wrong.
　Was she exhausted as well?[l] There's no way ‘Maou’ would show up.
　After all, Tsubaki still had the key.
　She had been listening closely all the while, but she didn't hear the sound of Tsubaki dropping anything into the garbage can.
　Tsubaki said, ‘So I should just throw the key in the garbage can?’[l] However, that was most likely something she just said by chance.[l] If Tsubaki were repeating ‘Maou's’ instructions intentionally, then she could have supplemented herself through other actions to further detail the situation.[l] She could even have thrown the key in with excessive noise, or made sure to speak out and confirm that she did so after throwing it in.[l] What's more, if Tsubaki were really repeating his instructions for Haru's sake, then the last thing she said, ‘I'm on my way,’ would be too vague for Haru to determine just where she would be going.
　‘Maou’ and Tsubaki's conversation was probably something along these lines:
‘So I should just throw the key in the garbage can?’
‘No, wait. Go to Central Boulevard instead.’
‘...I understand. I'm on my way.’
　Tsubaki has grown even more afraid of ‘Maou’ after her encounter with the police.[l] She's probably so anxious that her heart is about to explode.[l] In a situation like this one, it's easy to imagine that she wouldn't have the energy to concern herself with what Haru was up to.
　That was a moment that decided everything.[l] Simply interpreting a sentence incorrectly could have caused her to retire before this ordeal came to a conclusion.
“Still, just when is he planning to show up...?”
　Even as she spoke, Haru felt the time of battle rumbling toward her with impatient force.
　How many places has she been dragged to now?[l] She's forgotten just how many times she had changed locations.
　Continuously in a state of extreme tension, Tsubaki is puffing with every word.
“You've worked hard, Tsubaki.”
　The kidnapper was on the phone.
“It's almost nine... aren't your siblings asleep by now?”
“...Where next?”
　Tsubaki asked, breathing hard.
“I'll definitely give you the money. Give my brother back to me!”
“You just keep saying that, don't you?”
“It's all okay if Hiroaki comes back!”
“Is it really, though?”
“What?”
“Is it really ‘okay’ for you to just give me the money?”
　What are you saying at this point?[l] Tsubaki already lacks the strength to think things through.
“Isn't that your family's entire fortune?”
“Yes...”
“Without money, your brother might be back, but you'll lose your future. Is that really ‘okay’?”
“My brother's life has no price.”
　The criminal sighed, impressed.
“You say that life is worth more than money, but is that really true?”
“Of course. The value of a life could never be measured in yen.”
“To be able to say that proves that you've never experienced poverty.”
　Sure, Tsubaki has never seen her parents worried about being poor.[l] Her family might not be rich, but they're definitely not impoverished.
　The kidnapper kept on repeating questions that she just couldn't understand.[l] These subjects confused her.[l] Just what do they have to do with the ransom?
“Look, could... could you just end this already?”
“Are you at your limit?”
“No, I just don't know how long this is going to drag on...”
“Your brother's life is on the line, and you're complaining?”
　In an instant, the flame in Tsubaki's heart burned again.
“No! I just want to see my brother sooner!”
　Utterly unforgivable.[l] Tsubaki immediately began to doubt herself for feeling such intense hatred for this unforgivable criminal, but the moment that her words had burst the dam, she couldn't stop.
“I'm not going to just let you go! If something happens to Hiroaki, I'm not going to let you get away with it!”
　She could no longer understand anything.[l] What happened to the self that was worried about the kidnapper's feelings?[l] What would happen if she provoked him again?
　――I just want to see Hiroaki...
　That was the only thought in her heart.
“It's time...”
　The kidnapper suddenly spoke up.
“This is the final instruction. Go immediately and retrieve the briefcase, then go to the burger place on Central Boulevard and get there before nine-thirty.”
　There's no longer any time to write in her diary.
“N-nine-thirty, is it?”
　It'll be a stretch to make the trip in the short amount of time remaining.
“You can still make it if you hurry. Leave the briefcase on the sidewalk, and walk away immediately.”
“I understand...”
　She can only obey.
“If you're late, your brother is dead. This time will be the last. I'll contact you after I check the ransom.”
　The call ended.
　Tsubaki kept the cell to her ear for a moment longer.
　She had never thought that paying the ransom would be so exhausting.
　The kidnapper said that this would be the last place.[l] Up until now, he's said that every single time, and it was a lie every single time.[l] Still, this time feels different.
　She thought of the family waiting for her at home.[l] Her parents are probably worried about her.
　――I'll be back soon.
　Haru chased after Tsubaki with all her strength as she sprinted through Central Boulevard.[l] She rushed into the station and retrieved the briefcase.[l] Tsubaki might be tired, but she still moves amazingly quickly.[l] It's like she's using every ounce of strength remaining in her body.[l] The train station was in chaos.[l] She had no time to look for Kyousuke, who was supposed to be guarding the locker.
　――Dammit.
　Haru swept her gaze across the chaotic street.
　Her line of sight was blocked, almost completely.[l] Young people filled the street like a mudslide.[l] Just how many people had she bumped into already?[l] The shape of Tsubaki's coat would often get swallowed by the sea of people, momentarily gone without a trace.
　This is the route that Haru usually takes on the way home after work, but this is the first time she has seen it this crowded.
　She noted the reason for this almost instantly.
“Hey everyone～. I'm going to be on TV～!”
　A live television broadcast.[l] Everyone who wanted to see Kanon or be on television pressed ever closer to the stage.[l] On either side of the road were cars from the station and staff manning equipment.
　――This is the moment ‘Maou’ has been waiting for.
　It was so chaotic it was suffocating.[l] Truly an excellent chance to grab the ransom.
“Tsubaki!”
　Haru wants to stop Tsubaki to ask her where she's bringing the ransom, but her shouts were lost in the din of the crowd.
　Tsubaki didn't have time for questions anyway.[l] ‘Maou’ must be urging her on.[l] To have Tsubaki at a speed he's never asked of her before meant that, to ‘Maou’, this is the moment where the winner will be decided.
　――If I'm going to act, it has to be now...!
　Haru charged toward Tsubaki.
　Tsubaki, breathing hard, finally reached her destination.[l] She relentlessly prayed, ‘Please don't let it be nine-thirty.’
　The girl pushes through the sea of people, surging straight forward, knocking into the crowd.[l] People yell and curse at her.[l] She causes a lot of people a lot of trouble.[l] However, she can't spare the time to apologize anymore.
　She was in a hurry.[l] She even fell down, dropping the briefcase onto the ground.[l] That briefcase, more important than a life.[l] She held it tightly as she crossed the deluge of people with blinding speed.
“Haah, haah...”
　Tsubaki stopped.
　She looked around casually.[l] It should be okay to just drop it here, right?[l] It wouldn't be picked up by someone who isn't involved in this, would it?[l] The kidnapper said to put down the briefcase and run...
　At that moment, an unbelievably bright voice shot through the crowd from nearby amplifiers.
“All you viewers across Japan, it's nine-thirty!”
　Tsubaki was speechless, unable to believe her ears.
　――Why is Kanon...?
　It was way beyond her comprehension.[l] Still, she heard it clearly.
　It's nine-thirty.
　If I don't drop the briefcase and run, Hiroaki is dead――.
...Now.
At the exact moment Tsubaki set the attaché case on the ground, I went into action.
I walked through the crowd, closing in on the briefcase quickly.
I gripped the briefcase tightly.
It's been less than five seconds since it left its previous owner.
Everyone's eyes are focused on the radiant entrance of the famous figure skater, ‘Azai Kanon.’
This confusion is what I wanted.
I've been waiting all day to coordinate my retrieval of the ransom with this broadcast.
This chaos is what I wanted.
Even if the police were right behind me, I have confidence that I could escape.
That would be true for one reason alone: I am simply too familiar with this city.
I've considered many escape routes.
Usami is simply a girl, what can she do...?
“Stop that man with the briefcase!”
A shout from behind me penetrated the din of the spectacle.
It was Usami.
It seems that she's been closely following Tsubaki.
She caught a glimpse of me?
Anyway, Usami... just how many people do you think are carrying briefcases in this bustle of people so close to the business district?
As I expected, no one paid any attention to me.
“Thief! Thief!”
...Shouting is useless now.
I straightened up, walking casually.
If there was a thief, they'd be running for their life.
No one would think that I was a kidnapper.
“......”
No, something's wrong...
Along with a shiver down my spine, the stage speakers sent a sound to me.
“Huh, wuzzat～? Is there something going on down there～?”
Tch...
The broadcast could pose trouble.
If I face the cameras, there's a chance I'll be on film.
If my face surfaces during a piddly little ‘game’ like this, it may affect future plans.
I want to run right now, but doing so would be like announcing to everyone that I'm a thief.
“...!”
I crossed paths with someone and took the opportunity to peek behind me.
I caught a glimpse of Usami's long hair through the crowd.
　For just an instant, Haru saw the figure of a man holding a briefcase.[l] That was ‘Maou’.[l] She continued to push forward while trying her hardest to break through the mass of people.
“...!?”
　The next time she saw ‘Maou’, Haru ran straight into someone's arms.[l] After a word of apology, she escaped through his side.
　With anxiety urging her on, she continued searching for ‘Maou’.
　――There!
　Through the wall of men, women, and children, Haru could only get a glimpse of the briefcase.
　She surged forward with all her might in order to break through the barricade of people.
　The distance between them didn't decrease.[l] Haru held out her hand in the crowded tide of passersby.[l] Just a bit farther...[l] Just a bit farther and I'll catch you, ‘Maou’...!
I've passed the most chaotic part of the crowd.
Did I successfully lose Usami?
It's dangerous to turn my head around.
There's a chance that my face will be seen.
Usami might be able to reach me any second now.
Should I take a taxi, perhaps?
But with traffic the way it is right now, no car can take off immediately.
No, wait... a taxi...
I watched the side mirrors mounted on the taxis that lined the streets as I walked.
“......”
I was in luck, as the mirrors clearly reflected the uniform and hair of Usami... still trailing me.
It looks like she's holding something in her hand.
She's less than ten yards away.
Usami was likely able to get a lock on me, and is in pursuit.
...I don't want to attract attention, but there's no other choice.
I break into a run.
　‘Maou’ suddenly took off.[l] He didn't even turn back.[l] How did he know that she was getting closer?[l] Shortly thereafter, Haru saw the parked taxis strewn about on the road, and started to lament.
　Haru looked at ‘Maou's’ retreating figure.[l] He was a very tall man.[l] It was similar to the person that had confronted her last time, the man who had called himself ‘Maou’.[l] Because his legs were longer than hers, the distance between them just continued to increase.
　Yet chasing him was still quite easy.[l] To run in a crowd such as this means gathering attention.[l] The sounds of the people he pushed, the confused stares, all were focused on ‘Maou’.
　While pushing her way through idle bystanders, Haru watched as ‘Maou’ went inside a coffee shop.
　‘Like a rat in a trap,’ Haru thought.[l] But when Haru arrived in front of the store, she cursed her own thoughtlessness.[l] It was a large-scale chain coffee shop.[l] The shop covered a large area, being at the crossing of a major intersection.[l] Of course, there were more than two exits.[l] Even if it was for just a moment, she regretted slowing down.
　‘Maou’ ran in intentionally.[l] That must mean that he knows this city like the back of his hand.
　Should she give chase until the end?[l] Haru asked herself a question that needed no answer.[l] No matter what, she wants to catch him.[l] Both for Tsubaki, and for herself...
After passing through Central Boulevard, the crowd began to thin out considerably.
I turned around and took a few glances.
Even though it's hard to see in the nighttime lighting, the sound of people's insults reached me just fine.
Looks like Usami is still on my trail.
She's quite stubborn...
Let's get rid of her completely.
Jumping over the railing of the sidewalk, I rushed into the road.
I ran in front of cars moving at a snail's pace due to the traffic jam and made it to the sidewalk on the other side.
The cars' blaring horns are unending.
...This should help Usami find me more easily.
I continued my charge as I turned into a discreet alley.
A dark alley.
After seeing what awaited me there, I knew I had already won.
This game of tag is over now...
I took out a handkerchief and covered my fingers, ensuring that I won't leave fingerprints――――
“Sorry, excuse me!”
　Just how many times had she said that since nine-thirty?[l] Each time she was showered in annoyed stares and condemnations.[l] The thing she carried was bulky.[l] Haru glanced around, chasing after ‘Maou's’ image.
　Even though they'd left the extravagance of Central Boulevard, it was still very bright out.[l] The hundreds of cars on the street, all with lights on, were a very reliable boost to the visibility.
　The sound of horns suddenly rang out from the road.
　Glancing over, it seemed that a man who looked like ‘Maou’ was casually jaywalking.[l] His face was hidden behind the blindingly bright headlights of the vehicles he blitzed past.[l] It was regrettable, but there was nothing Haru could do about it.
　Just like that, ‘Maou’ turned into an alley between two buildings.[l] Haru hurriedly pursued him.
　It was an incredibly narrow alley with a horrible line of sight.[l] Not even two people would be able to walk abreast.
　――Is he inviting me to follow him?
　Even though Haru was reluctant, there wasn't much room for her to think.
　As she gave chase, rushing into the darkness, she felt something weird under her foot.[l] She lost her balance and fell forward to the ground.
“...!?”
　It was the feel of flesh.[l] Haru was shocked, and the thing that she stepped on screamed.[l] As she calmed down, she realized it was a human leg.
“I-I'm sorry. Are you okay!?”
　She stooped down instinctively.[l] A peculiar, putrid odor filled her nose.[l] A few homeless men sat on the ground.[l] They stared at Haru with lifeless eyes before losing interest again.
　They seemed to be distracted by something.[l] They were kneeling, furiously moving their hands.[l] It looked as though they were digging, as if they were trying to stir the darkened ground.
　――Money...
　Haru could see a few bills poking out from under their hands.
　‘I've already lost,’ she said to herself, full of regret.[l] She lifted her head and glanced down to the other end of the alley.
　‘Maou’, the enigma whom Haru had her sights nailed to, was now nowhere to be seen.
“...Tsubaki.”
　A murmur escaped her lips before a wave of exhaustion overcame her.
　The day-long battle had finally come to an end.
...
......
“In any case, everyone worked very hard...”
I talked as if nothing had happened.
Only Tsubaki and her father were in the living room.
“I'm sorry that I wasn't of any help...”
“No, it's alright. Thank you.”
“Did you do everything that the kidnapper ordered you to do, Tsubaki?”
“Umm, I think... some things happened about halfway through, though.”
“Then the perpetrator should release Hiroaki.”
“I certainly hope so...”
I wiped the sweat on my forehead and exhaled deeply.
Today's work was insanely busy.
I can't believe that I had to run all across the city.
Gonzou really works me hard.
“I'm sorry, Azai-kun. We've put such a load on your shoulders...”
“Please, don't worry about it. Everyone's in the same boat here. I'll try to help as much as I can from now on.”
From now on, of course, means the paperwork.
Since the ransom has been taken, there's no way the Miwa family can possibly pay back the fifty million.
The moment the time limit is up, the loaner will immediately take the land as collateral...
“...So all that's left is Haru-chan...”
“What did you say?”
“Haru-chan might be able to catch the kidnapper for us.”
“Right... Usami...”
That irritating woman...
Usami is going to catch the kidnapper, she says...?
“Tsubaki, did you ask her to do that?”
“I didn't really ask her, I just told her that she can do what she wants.”
“...I see.”
This girl is an idiot...
If you were going to rely on someone like Usami, you might as well have just called the police in the first place. They're many times better than her.
“Haru-chan has really given it her best shot. I think that she'll give us a happy ending.”
She said that, opening her deep eyes.
...It seems that these two women have been playing a cute little game of friendship while I was gone.
“Anyway, catching the kidnapper would be best.”
I brushed away a smidgen of worry.
When you stop to think for a second, there's no way a girl like Usami could go up against a kidnapper who abducted a child and demanded a ransom in stock certificates.
I say that, and I might just be paranoid, but there does seem to be something about Usami hiding under the surface.
It'd be very problematic to me if the kidnapper didn't successfully get the ransom.
“...Ah, speak of the devil.”
A sound came from the front door.
“Hi...”
I was suddenly faced with a monstrous sight.
“Yo, Usami, why are you sweating so much?”
“Yeah, well, let's just say I need to start running more often...”
Spouting her typical nonsense, she rested against the door frame.
“Azai-san, thank you.”
“...Hmm?”
“Didn't you help watch the locker?”
“Ah, right... when we met on the street by coincidence? Right, the ransom was in the locker, and you told me to guard it...”
“Thanks for the help, really.”
“I didn't see any suspicious people going near it.”
“Great. And I know you were busy, I'm sorry.”
It took around an hour...
By Usami's request, I stayed near the station locker.
There was still some time before my next meeting, so I did her a favor...
After organizing my memory, I calmed down.
“Oh, and Usami...”
She didn't seem all that happy.
“What happened?”
Well, I can imagine she didn't catch the culprit, at least...
“Haru-chan.”
Tsubaki gave her hopeful eyes.
I don't know when it started, but my palm was full of sweat.
“......”
Very quickly, Usami lowered her head in front of Tsubaki.
“I'm sorry, the kidnapper got away.”
Usami's expression was twisted by agony.
...So she does have an expression like that.
“Don't worry about it. Just the thought that you were by my side, ah, well... actually I was too tense to really think about anything, but still, it was really reassuring.”
“I'm sorry...”
I also put on my most cheerful tone.
“Now come on, don't beat yourself up over it.”
“......”
“We did what the kidnapper wanted us to do. We didn't contact the police, either. After he gets the ransom, he'll definitely be satisfied, and release Hiroaki-kun.”
At that, Usami suddenly spoke up.
“I'm sorry, but he won't.”
“What...?”
“Huh?”
“Are you saying that Hiroaki-kun isn't going to come back?”
“Yes.”
She said it with no sign of hesitation.
“Why? I know we can't guarantee that he'll keep his promise, but why are you so sure of it?”
“Yeah. He already got the ransom, so all we can do is believe in him now...”
Usami slowly shook her head.
“He didn't get the ransom.”
...What did you say?
“...W-what are you talking about? I put down the briefcase in front of the burger place like he said. Did someone else take it?”
In the face of Tsubaki's questions, Usami just continued to shake her head.
“Tsubaki, do you remember what I said this morning?”
“Huh?”
“Even in the worst-case scenario, I wasn't going to let him get away with the ransom.”
“Ah, yeah... you said that even if he got away, there'd still be a chance for another exchange...”
Usami nodded.
“So I did just that.”
“H-how?”
“You don't remember?”
“Remember what?”
Then, Usami slowly reached behind her.
Opening the half-closed door behind her, she picked something up.
“The briefcase!?”
Tsubaki gasped.
It wasn't just Tsubaki; everyone was looking at Usami in awe.
I, who debriefed Tsubaki earlier, have already guessed what stunt Usami pulled.
“You swapped cases?”
“A guess worthy of your reputation, Azai-san. That's right, I bumped into Tsubaki on Central Boulevard.”
“Ah!”
Tsubaki seemed to remember.
“I did get knocked over by someone, and lost hold of the briefcase... that was you, Haru-chan?”
“I swapped cases then. The briefcase that I prepared was empty.”
“When did you prepare it?”
“In the morning, after Tsubaki got her case, I bought one of the same model. Six thousand yen was a lot for me, but that's not important anymore.”
...What a girl.
“So the kidnapper took the empty briefcase and got away?”
“Yes. The ransom, the stock certificates, are still in this briefcase.”
So that means Usami had held this briefcase while chasing the culprit.
Suddenly, Tsubaki's father opened his mouth.
“That means... the money is still here...?”
It looks like he's still not ready to let go of his land.
His words carried a trace of happiness.
“Haru-chan... so that...”
Tsubaki sighed, moved.
I sighed too, but mine held a completely different meaning from Tsubaki's.
“Yeah... that means today was a stalemate...”
“I hope so...”
Even though her expression was backed with confidence, there was still a shred of anxiety in her words.
“Just don't make the kidnapper too angry...”
“Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.”
“Is that all you have to say? Do you even realize that Hiroaki-kun's life is on the line?”
Meddling little...!
“A-Azai-kun, don't. Haru-chan was just trying to help...”
“I'm very glad for your concern, Azai-kun, but this stock represents the future of my entire family. I'm very happy that you managed to save this for us, Usami-san.”
Even Tsubaki's father cut in.
“...True, sorry.”
I'll just put up my laudable persona.
“You thought that he wouldn't release the hostage even if he got the ransom, right Usami?”
“That's correct. The criminal, ‘Maou’, is probably a prudent person. To be clear, no matter whether or not he got the ransom, there's a high chance that he wasn't planning to release the hostage.”
“Oh, I see how it is then. Since the hostage isn't going to be coming back anyway, might as well keep him from getting the ransom. Right?”
I said it mockingly.
“How logical. You, Usami, are a woman so truly logical that it's frightening.”
“......”
Usami was silent.
“Usami-san, I carry the responsibility for not contacting the police. Please don't worry too much about things.”
“That's right. Even if the police were here, there's still a chance that he would have gotten away.”
...Haah, I don't like watching scenes like this.
“Well then, would you mind giving me the certificates now?”
Tsubaki's father asked Usami for his family's savings.
Usami said that she understood, and opened the case.
――Unimaginable.
“What is this...?”
Her eyes widened.
Usami's face was bleached white in an instant.
In contrast, a shout of victory welled up in my chest.
As if there was a demon baring his fangs inside me, mocking Usami...
“Gone...”
A shocked Usami, an Usami who had been turned to stone, murmured.
“They're gone...”
Her face was adorned with an expression of defeat.
“The ransom... the certificates... they're gone...”
　The weather had been rather unstable recently.[l] Sometimes it would snow from nightfall straight through to dawn.[l] Yet as time pushed forward, the asphalt pavement dried, leaving Tsubaki nothing but inconsistent, blurred traces of white by the time she awakened.
　Tsubaki ignored her racing heart and stood as still as a street lamp, gazing at the familiar home her family was about to leave.
　The ants patrolled in squadrons near her feet.[l] A black cloud of them gathered around a moth's broken wing and moved it to the colony in the garden.[l] Perhaps the decaying innocence within Tsubaki's heart also served as valuable food in preparation for the upcoming spring.[l] The overwhelming kidnapping, her responsibility to her family, and her feelings for Kyousuke might all be guiding her to a nest that most suited her true self.
　Hiroaki walked out the door.[l] He closed in on Tsubaki like a puppy.
“Alright, let's go.”
　He made a fist, bent down, and then jumped with excitement.[l] He looked up at Tsubaki with a bright, floral smile.[l] Her brother's every move was dear to her.
　She'll take Hiroaki to kindergarten, then head to school.[l] This was her daily routine.[l] If Hiroaki begged for a snack halfway, she would stop by a convenience store; if he wanted to play, she'd comply as long as time allowed.
　He was a child, after all.[l] As his big sister, it's only natural for her to indulge him.
　But today was different.[l] Tsubaki wouldn't go to school, but will rather wait for Kyousuke to contact her.[l] Depending on the schedule Kyousuke set out for her, she might not even go to pick up Hiroaki.
　She continued to hold onto her brother's hand.[l] His chubby little arms were quite soft under her fingers.
“Your hands are so soft, Sis.”
“Are you saying I'm fat?”
　Her tone suddenly grew strict.
“You're soft too, Hiroaki. Are you eating too many snacks?”
“Cool, they're just like your hands. Dad always says I'm just like you.”
“Just like me...”
　Her brother's innocent smile made Tsubaki a touch uneasy.[l] It was as if she'd seen that exact smile elsewhere.[l] As if she'd seen it a sickening number of times...[l] within the polished glass of the mirror, every day of her life.
　Why?[l] What was it about her brother that bothered her?
“...Let's go.”
　As a twisted emotion gathered in her chest and ran down to her gut, she noticed that she was dripping with sweat.
　Kyousuke must be an early riser.[l] His call came a few short moments after seven o'clock.
　After glancing at her brother as he hummed beside her, she took the cell phone in her hands.
“You're up early, Azai-kun.”
“Does that inconvenience you?”
　An inquisitional tone came from the other end of the line.[l] Though Kyousuke's tone changed often, there was a critical difference between this and the boy she'd become accustomed to at school.
　Tsubaki responded as if intimidated by his mannerisms.
“Not at all. Would now be a good time to come over?”
“Are you outside right now?”
“Huh?　Yeah...”
“Shall I infer that this means you're escorting a sibling to kindergarten?”
　Tsubaki panicked when he pinpointed the situation right away.
“Come quickly.”
“Right now?”
“Right now.”
　An alarm rang in Tsubaki's heart.[l] She hadn't experienced such anxiety since her last meeting with ‘Maou’.[l] She had neither the courage nor even the intent to defy him.
“I understand. I'll come right away.”
　Tsubaki's answer seemed to have satisfied Kyousuke.[l] He thanked her and hung up.
“Onee-chan, what's wrong?”
　Kids are really good at reading people's feelings, she thought.
　The words Tsubaki wanted to say were stuck in her throat.[l] Still, Tsubaki could only relax if she let the desires she'd only recently formed guide her.[l] It's nothing strange for a girl her age to be happier with friends than family...
“Hiroaki, can you go by yourself?”
　Her brother had been kidnapped once.
“You can, right? You said you could do it by yourself yesterday.”
　After learning of her brother's kidnapping, Tsubaki had burst into tears.[l] She could do nothing but cry and shout, ‘It's all because I was late picking him up.’
“Your sister has something really important to do right now, so we have to say bye-bye here.”
　Burying the perplexed emotions deep in her heart, she left her old self behind.
　Was it really such a cruel thing to do, abandoning her brother to help the man she loves work?[l] While it did come with the added cost of skipping school, it was nothing as severe as breaking the law, nor was it an act atrocious enough to earn the contempt of others.[l] It was merely taking a risk.
　Tsubaki, who always worried about such trivial things, suddenly noticed how insignificant she was.[l] She couldn't help getting angry.
“I'm leaving now... I'll pick you up later.”
　Her brother knew nothing about Tsubaki's feelings, and tilted his head.
“My school ends at noon today, so won't you still be at your school, Onee-chan?”
　Tsubaki broke out into a sweat once more after being stared into by Hiroaki's innocent pupils.
“Onee-chan's school ends at noon too today.”
　Being put on the spot, she lied without thinking.[l] In the end, Tsubaki still promised to pick up her brother, but this may have been purely a function of remorse or guilt.
“Alright, I'll be waiting here. Play kick-the-can with me, okay?”
“Sure...”
　She averted her eyes.
　Afterward, she silently made her way to Kyousuke's house.[l] The crowded train to Central Boulevard gave her the impression that everyone was watching her, leaving her unsettled all the while.
...
......
I led Tsubaki to my room.
When I met her at the station, she bore a grim, shadowed, alien expression.
“So you really showed up.”
“Thanks for inviting me.”
“Um, is this your first time here?”
“No, it's my second time...”
...Ah, that's right.
“Are you feeling alright? I apologize for calling you over all of a sudden.”
Tsubaki weakly shook her head, indicating there was no problem.
“Is something troubling you?”
“Huh? What do you mean?”
“It's written all over your face.”
I laughed.
“Your relationship with your family hasn't been smooth lately, huh?”
“...Is it that obvious?”
She looked embarrassed, like a child caught red-handed.
“Don't you think you've been a bit too easy on them in the past?”
“Are you saying I care too much?”
“I know it's difficult to manage a big family, but isn't it enough to just do what needs to be done? You brought your brother to kindergarten before you arrived here, didn't you?”
“...Huh?”
“What? You didn't?”
Tsubaki only replied with a quiet nod.
...She seems to have allocated my directions as the top priority. She rushed here after leaving her brother.
“I didn't go to school either.”
“Do you feel bad about it? You'll get used to it soon enough...”
“Y-yeah. But is that something that someone should really get used to?”
Whether it's a problem or not is something a person should generally decide for oneself, but we don't have the time to waste over trivial things like that so long as she's going to be following my directions.
The old Tsubaki, that straight-laced and honest girl, would be of questionable use to me.
I was hoping for a relationship on par with those between cult leaders and their followers.
No matter how ridiculous and inhumane the leader's commands become, the followers will always take them as the gospel from God and obey.
Does Tsubaki have the potential to become the zealous believer that I wish for...?
“Hey, Tsubaki. Aren't you interested in the reason I'm working like this?”
Tsubaki snapped her head in surprise after suddenly being asked a question.
I decided to blow my cover and reveal everything.
“I might be living a luxurious life right now, but there was a time when I lived in absolute poverty.”
“...Huh? Really?”
She sighed as her eyes betrayed her shock.
I remember reading a random query on anthropology, that knowing about someone's past leads you to sympathize with them.
I need to close the gap between Tsubaki and me.
“It started around the beginning of middle school. Prior to my enrollment there, I had a happy family. After a certain occurrence, though, everything began to change.”
“...An occurrence?”
“I know I'm the one who brought it up and everything, but please don't ask about that. It's the source of many a headache.”
“I understand. Sorry...”
I slowly refreshed my memories.
“Even if I told you, you might not believe me...”
I recalled my past.
I slowly opened the closed book to page one.
Every time I look back, the same scenery appears before my eyes.
Samejima Kyousuke, an anxious child, alone in a dark room.
“It was a nameless village in Hokkaido...”
“My mom and I lived in a shack adjacent to the cattle fodder and hay storage of a small farm.”
“When winter reached our home, the temperatures dropped below zero. Our windows weren't double-layered.”
“The flooring reeked of cow feces, and centipedes fought spiders over hairs and a few scattered rice grains. To my surprise, cockroaches managed to survive there too, so far up north.”
“W-why did... why did you live a life like that?”
“...My father destroyed my home.”
“Your father?”
“Yes. You may have heard me say ‘Papa’ before, but when I do so, I'm referring to my foster father. He adopted me some time later due to certain circumstances.”
“In any case, my real father was already gone by the time of this story.”
“He wasn't missing or dead or anything, but he owed the mafia a lot of money.”
“Thus, my mom and I had to constantly keep moving.”
“And in the end, we settled down in what was essentially a literal pigsty.”
“......”
“A distant relative lent us the place. His name was Kannu, or something like that. Apparently it carries some sort of discriminatory nuance in that region, but I'm not sure.”
“Kannu gave us a place to stay when we had nowhere else to go, but he was a real son of a bitch, with a criminal record to prove it.”
“He might have been doing some day labor, but he would sometimes harass my mom by flaunting his earnings.”
“My mom had a few random jobs too, but the village provided few employment opportunities for outsiders. As a result, we could only obey Kannu's every whim.”
“The biggest problem was kerosene. The price for kerosene in farming villages is unbelievably high, and when it's cold enough to make your nose run, an empty oil can is practically a death sentence.”
“Though Mom often made fuel for the heater her top priority, the lack of resources grew more dire each day.”
“We lit that old heater once a day, and that would guarantee us an hour or two of warmth. My mother and I always took that opportunity to wrap ourselves up in sheets and talk about anything and everything.”
“‘If only we had more money...’ That's what I always said.”
“I begged for a job as a paper delivery boy, but Mom didn't permit it. She was worried that my body couldn't withstand the cold. She said that walking in the snowy mountains to deliver newspapers would be too harsh for a child.”
“Yet still, our fuel stockpiles were waning by the day. I think a snowstorm forced the whole village into a shortage. Only one hour was left of the heartwarming two hours each day.”
“I talked to all the students at my middle school——it was a small school, no more than fifty kids in total——I pleaded with them, every last one, to share what they could.”
“In the end, they passed me off as a beggar and provided nothing. They said, ‘You must be wasting oil all the time. That's why you don't have enough.’ They didn't share a drop.”
“We never wasted anything. But then I thought that maybe everyone else was in the same situation as we were, but were patiently enduring it. I returned home, feeling a bit bad about what I had done.”
“But after thinking about it, it did seem a bit strange. Our fuel was being used up faster than we were consuming it. I even began to suspect my own mother of using the heater in my absence.”
“Shortly thereafter, I met Kannu in front of our shack. He became enraged when he saw me, and started yelling desperately.”
“‘Who do you think is letting you live here?’ The bastard was swinging a jar of kerosene back and forth. I think he stole it from us.”
“I questioned him. He was as muscular as a bear, and his face was always red, as if he were constantly intoxicated. Upon hearing our argument, the people living nearby gathered 'round.”
“Kannu was a cunning man. He was good at keeping up facades and hiding his true self. He pretended to be a saint helping some outside woman and her young son make ends meet. Thus, in the end, we were the ones in the wrong.”
“Some time later, I mentioned it to a schoolteacher.”
“However, from that one conversation, I finally understood how the people in the village viewed my mother and I.”
“Working at a bar on the outskirts of the village seemed to have earned Mom a bad reputation.”
“Come on, it was just a bar. It's not like she was a prostitute. Still, the people in the village used the Hokkaido farming village dialect to humiliate my mom as if she were one.”
“I used this chance, and begged my mother to leave the village with me.”
“But she was too exhausted. She's a kind woman, but she was just too exhausted... and there was nowhere to go, so there was really nothing we could've done...”
“......”
“And then one day, our heater suddenly began having enough oil to burn through the whole night.”
“Kannu's attitude changed, too. He bought stuff for me, trying to win me over. He stopped calling me a brat, and sometimes the three of us had dinner together.”
“As a kid, I never wondered why a hypocrite like Kannu suddenly decided to help us.”
“And then I saw why.”
“I saw the sight of a woman lying hogtied, screaming.”
“In my very home, no less. Maybe I shouldn't have taken the day off due to illness.”
“The thick smell of alcohol was nearly suffocating. A one liter beer bottle laid upturned on the floor.”
“The bear of a man had just finished drinking, and didn't even try to hide his naked lower body. He just stared at me. I still remember those foul, yellow eyes, that face like rock, those hard, pulsating muscles...”
“Kannu's strong body, trained by years of manual labor, scared me to death. I was overwhelmed. He beat me that night until I thought my stomach would fly out. He kicked me until my back was breaking.”
“Mom protected me, crying nonstop. The son of a bitch just screamed a few curses at her and yanked her by the hair. He approached her, his breath saturated with the cloying scent of alcohol, all the while staring at me with glaring eyes.”
“――‘Kyousuke, you can't take this, can you!? Why can't you take this!? Can you take this!? It's all your fault! It's all because you don't have money...!!!’”
“The fucker never stopped talking. He reminded us that he was the real owner of our filthy pigsty. ‘Get out if you don't like it, you animals.’ He proudly stated that he was free to treat his livestock as he pleased.”
“――‘If you animals don't want to accept this, you can get to work. So, Kyousuke. Can you feed your mother? Can you rent a house, can you go to school, can you make a living?’”
“Mom bowed down and apologized. She said it was our fault. She pretended to be strong, told me she was okay, and then demanded that I apologize immediately to that son of a bitch.”
“I obeyed my mother.”
......
...
Tsubaki's shoulder shivered like she was struck by lightning as she stood silent.
“That was a long story. What do you think?”
“......”
Tsubaki frowned and mumbled.
“What a bad person... your poor mother...”
I think I just wasted my breath.
“Mm, that's not what I mean. That asshole was trash, and my mother was unfortunate, yes. True enough, but what I want to say is, Tsubaki...”
I paused for a moment before continuing.
“Back then, if I had only a fraction of the money I have now...”
“But... weren't you only a middle school student back then?”
“Take a good look at Central Boulevard. There are people who are obviously elementary school students claiming to be high school students in order to sell accessories or tickets, right?”
“Yeah, but... this is a big city.”
“Anyway, I didn't have any money. My luck might be rotten, but what do you expect? No goddess of luck would shine on someone who couldn't pay the fee.”
Suddenly, Tsubaki seemed to have thought of something, and said,
“My family should be okay, right...?”
“I think their situation's quite severe. Have you noticed your dad being sort of grim lately?”
“No, not at all... isn't he kind of optimistic?”
“I don't know. But just in case, I'd like you to take what I said to heart.”
“...Yeah. I should try to support my family, everyone's counting on me.”
“I'll compensate you for your work if you decide to help me. It won't be much, but I think you'll find the pay is a lot better than a part-time job.”
I smiled, and the tension left Tsubaki's face.
“I'll do my best. After hearing your story, I feel that I should evaluate my family again.”
“...What do you mean?”
“I mean Hiroaki. What do you think of that kid?”
“Hmm... I think he's spoiled compared to the average child...”
“That's about right. I think I'm spoiling him too.”
“You could be doing him a disservice, you know. He'll only be worse off for it as an adult.”
“That's what the teachers from his kindergarten say too.”
“Then I'll go ahead and tell you the rest. To be honest, I've seen some things I didn't really approve of in your dealings with him.”
I crossed my arms in front of my chest and continued.
“Why don't you scold him? I think it would be for the best if you got seriously angry once in a while.”
“...I scolded him for the first time recently.”
“The time when he ran out of the house at night without permission?”
I lightly sighed.
...That was more like Tsubaki screaming hysterically than a proper scolding.
“Wouldn't it be better if you put more feeling into it?”
“Really? How would I do that?”
“Are you... seriously asking that?”
“I've never been mad at anyone, so I don't know how to express it.”
“Isn't it okay to just let your feelings guide you? Take out all your anger, and even a child would understand how you feel.”
“Okay...”
Tsubaki's pupils were overcome by a strange glow.
“I'll try it.”
She gave me a straight stare.
“If he leaves by himself again, then I'll...”
That sentence seemed to be to herself as much as to me.
“We've chatted for a long time now...”
“Right, um, so what should I do?”
“Do you know how to use a computer?”
“I can surf the internet.”
“Good, then have a look at the data over there first.”
I pointed at a pile of paper on the table.
It's a list of buildings managed by the Souwa Alliance.
Facility management is broad and complicated, but the Azai Corporation's capabilities are widely recognized.
“Th-these? All of them...? Aren't there around five hundred of them?”
“What you're doing is very simple. Go through the list and pull out any files that include supplementary facilities.”
“Supplementary facilities?”
“For example, swimming pools, parking lots, or sports grounds. After you pick them out, input their names and phone numbers into the computer.”
“...That sounds really time-consuming...”
“You should be done by dusk.”
“Dusk...”
It seems that she had something to say but stopped for some reason.
“What? Did you have any prior engagements?”
“N-no, it shouldn't be a problem...”
“I'll be in the room right there. Just call me if you have any questions.”
Tsubaki started organizing the documents right away.
...
......
“Hey, Tsubaki. Your cell phone is ringing.”
I took a break and checked up on Tsubaki during the afternoon.
Tsubaki froze, staring intently at the cell phone.
“It's from home... what should I do?”
“What do you mean, what should you do? Pick it up. You should be at school now, right?”
“Oh yeah... why am I panicking...?”
The ringing stopped as we spoke.
“Ah...”
“Are you gonna call them back?”
“Nah. It's probably nothing important, anyway. Dad is always making meaningless phone calls now that I bought a cell phone.”
Tsubaki returned to her work once more.
...She seems to be doing a good job.
The names of the buildings are already listed on the computer monitor.
“You're in good shape.”
“Really? I might be suitable for easy jobs like this...”
“You really helped me out. I'm glad I found you, Tsubaki.”
“Really?”
She glanced at me happily through the corner of her eye.
“Hey, Azai-kun...”
“Yes?”
“I told Hiroaki I'd pick him up in the afternoon.”
“...Ah...”
“I promised to meet him at the park. He'll make it home by himself, right? If I don't show up?”
“Well, normally he would...”
“Yeah...”
“...But are you sure that's okay?”
I pressed her.
It's no fun if she just leaves in the middle of work.
But Tsubaki is already the kind of person I want her to be.
“I'll head out when I get the work done. Hiroaki can get home on his own just fine.”
“I want to work hard and make money for my family. That would be a better use of my time, even for Hiroaki.”
“......”
“This might sound a little bit, you know... but if we had money, we wouldn't have had to leave our home, right? And we wouldn't have had to borrow money when Hiroaki was kidnapped.”
“Now you get what I was saying earlier.”
Tsubaki smiled.
“I'm so glad I met you, Azai-kun.”
“Why bring that up now?”
“Well, you have a lot of qualities that I lack.”
Tsubaki has plenty that I lack, too... or rather, she is composed entirely of qualities I lack.
Still, in the end, she will become a person like me.
A suspicious, cheating, self-protective schemer.
These traits are neither just nor evil. Everyone acts this way.
I was filled with a sense of satisfaction, having confirmed that my way of life was not mistaken.
“Well, let's work for a bit longer.”
“Yeah...”
After that, Tsubaki pushed her natural, hardworking tendencies to 120%.
Until the moment she clocked out, her hands worked swiftly, as if her perplexed heart had already been blown away by the wind.
......
...
Afterward, the sky darkened, and I walked Tsubaki home.
Of course, sending her safely home wasn't my only reason for doing so...
Tsubaki and I walked side by side in the deserted park.
“......”
I gazed into her face and casually stepped in toward her.
Tsubaki was pressured into taking a step backwards.
...Now, then.
I had fooled around with Tsubaki for two days.
Or should I say, Tsubaki wasted two of my days.
Two of my precious days had been wasted by a woman whom I have no interest in.
I just thought it might pay off in the future if I could make an obedient dog out of her.
I've also gotten her address and phone number. She could serve as a last resort in times of difficulty.
She's wasted a lot of my time recently. It's only natural to have her compensate for it.
“Tsubaki, I've known your feelings all along.”
“...A-, alright... what brought this on?”
I stared into Tsubaki.
Her round eyes glowed in the dark with apprehension.
But at the same time, a feeling of anticipation lurked within them.
...If you want a bitch to do what you want, you have to eat her up... quoth Gonzou.
“I love you too, Tsubaki.”
I reached my hands out as I spoke.
“Wah-...!”
Tsubaki was shocked by my bold actions, and shook her head a bit in resistance, but that was short-lived.
“Azai-kun...”
She nuzzled her face into my chest like a kitten.
“I-, I'm so nervous.”
She turned sweet pretty fast, too.
......
...
The kidnapping had already been abandoned to the corner of our minds, alongside other memories.
My obedient Tsubaki followed me, losing all sorts of things, but accumulating money in compensation.
Rather than returning to the family who patiently awaited her, she decided to make my house her home.
Her diary had been abandoned long ago, and in its place, she input passage after passage into the computer.
She's now helping me work every day, and going out at night whenever there's time.
In short, a considerable amount of time has passed.
“Kyousuke-san, I'm back.”
A voice came from the door.
“You're late.”
“Sorry, I went to a club for a while.”
“If you walk the streets at night looking like that, people might think you're a prostitute.”
“Don't you dare group me with them.”
Her mannerisms have become more crude as well.
Cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, she's tried it all.
She even met Gonzou once.
Surprisingly, Gonzou had a liking for Tsubaki.
He said the more pure the person is, the more potential for evil they have.
“Get this data into the computer quickly. Also, I want this here mailed out by tomorrow morning.”
“Sure. I'll get it done even if I have to give up sleep.”
A slave to my orders, Tsubaki.
She became my assistant before I even noticed.
I will continue to follow Gonzou, but one day, I, too, will reach the top of this dark world.
“Hey.”
I slowly caressed her breasts.
Tsubaki's body reacted with a jump.
The smell of a woman tickled my senses.
I began toying with her body, sucking her lips.
Teasing, violating her.
“Mh, aah... no, don't... ah, ah hah...!”
I thrust endlessly through her gasps and screams.
I wanted to destroy something inside Tsubaki.
But as for what that was, my instincts told me I'd never find out.
...I thank God for that every day.
......
...
　The temperature dropped sharply as the sun sank into the west.[l] Even blending into the crowds along Central Boulevard couldn't ease the bitter cold.
　High school students were going home, being targeted by late-night shows' cameras for interviews.[l] The entire scene had already made its way into the realm of the routine.[l] They'd all become ecstatic once they faced the microphone.[l] If Kyousuke demanded it, Tsubaki could act exactly like those girls in front of the camera, full of passion.
　A store window in the streets caught her attention as she wandered.[l] Behind it was a plastic mannequin in a tempting pose and a famous, brand-name dress.
“How nice...”
　She mumbled.[l] She looked into herself, vainly trying to confirm if those were her true feelings.[l] No answer came.[l] It only caused restlessness in her heart.[l] Between Tsubaki and the mannequin, her reflection in the glass bore such a frightening visage that she couldn't recognize herself.
　As the cold tortured her body, Tsubaki headed to the subway station.
...
......
After Tsubaki left, I suddenly spotted an object she had left behind.
A familiar notebook.
That precious record Tsubaki had once held close to her.
...How could she forget to take something she valued so much?
People who write in a diary might be able to contain their emotions through it, but I haven't seen her writing anything at all lately.
...Even so, I doubt it's something she's willing to part with just yet.
I called Tsubaki.
Yet all I heard was the mechanical voice of an unavailable recipient.
...Is she on a train?
Maybe she turned it off. Tsubaki might really do that.
Well, I'm headed to Central Boulevard anyway, so I'll drop it off while I'm out.
I put on a coat and left the house.
Waiting for me outside was a breeze cold enough to snap me back to reality.
　She might have caught a cold.[l] She felt dull, and sweat beaded on her forehead.[l] Her body temperature was unstable; her feverish sensation was soon replaced by chills.[l] Tsubaki walked through the park with empty footsteps.
　As if her legs were plated with lead, she kept on moving forward, forward... rushing toward home.
　——Why am I panicking? She slowed her steps as she wondered.
　Tsubaki must feel guilty for skipping class.
　No, maybe it's because she was on a bit of a high after being accepted by Kyousuke.
　Carrying all kinds of uneasiness, her steps grew heavier.
　For example, what about the exchange student, Usami Haru?[l] Tsubaki treated her as a friend without ever thinking twice.[l] Before she knew it, she'd already started to hate Haru.
　After listening to Kyousuke's story, she understood what a scary thing debt can be.[l] Thankfully, Kyousuke had provided her with a house to move to, but beyond that, the only thing awaiting their arrival was a life of poverty.[l] Couldn't her father think up a better solution?[l] Tsubaki lost her breath.[l] Why is it always me who has to do the worrying——?
　Then the true source of Tsubaki's anxiety appeared.
“Ah, Onee-chan, you're finally here～...!”
　Tsubaki's brother dashed toward her.
　He waited for her like it was the most natural thing in the world.
　His innocent smile showed no fear of the bitter cold.
　Her body felt a different sort of chill.[l] The reflection she had seen in the shop window just earlier couldn't possibly smile like her brother anymore.
　Sadness, rage overcame her.[l] Tsubaki had already completely forgotten the fact that she, herself, broke the promise, and stared solemnly at Hiroaki.
“Why didn't you go home?”
　The accumulated despair dropped deep into Tsubaki's heart. The sound it created as it landed rebounded off of the darkness it found there, and escaped through Tsubaki's mouth in the form of words.[l] These were all delivered straight to Hiroaki's ears.
“You're such a pain sometimes...”
...The downtown crowd is as annoying as always.
I'm taking the subway to the Eastern District.
I doze off, thinking about Tsubaki.
I've witnessed her personality change firsthand.
Like ink dripping onto a clean sheet of paper, she's slowly losing her original form.
Just as they say, as difficult as creation is, destruction is easy.
The innocence Tsubaki had been raised with since she was young vanished without a trace right after her introduction to money.
Which means it was no stronger than that to begin with.
Tsubaki's kindness was only a fragile, insignificant thing.
One could say that fragility was because she hadn't built up a strong enough buffer against philosophical insult.
True enough, I've been inducing Tsubaki, and she's experienced a number of misfortunes that left her vulnerable.
There was that kidnapping, and as a result of it, they've been forced into major debt and have been chased from their home.
Still, I thought,
Is it really acceptable for humans to be that weak...?
No matter the circumstances, the core of the problem lies with the one being exploited.
Everyone knows that's where the responsibility lies, but saying so before the masses would lead to criticism, so people choose to stay silent.
My hands might be filthy, but I'm correct.
——I steeled my resolve again and delivered my body over to exhaustion.
......
...
　Tsubaki couldn't take it anymore.[l] The snowflakes falling to the ground froze her reason.
“Tell me how many times you've done this. Didn't I tell you not to come out by yourself?”
　Although she inquired in a cold tone, her brother was ignorant to the changes in Tsubaki.
“Listen to me first. Masato-kun's... er, Masato-kun is my friend by the way... anyway, his family bought a dog. It's so cute. I want one too, buy me one.”
　The veins in her temple throbbed.
“Hey, buy me one. It's a chihuahua. Buy me one-.”
“...Do you know how much money it would cost?”
“Not really. Is it expensive? Even more expensive than all the ice cream in the store?”
“Obviously.”
　Is he so spoiled that he doesn't even know a thing like that?
“But, Onee-chan, you bought a game system for me once. Everybody says it's expensive and they envy me.”
　That ‘me’ doesn't exist anymore.
“I don't have any money.”
“Liar, I've seen your savings box, Sis. There's a lot of money inside.”
“You shouldn't just go around peeking in people's wallets.”
“Eh-? But, I've always been using that money for snacks.”
“Really, you need to stop that.”
　She always thought he was too adorable to deny, and let him get whatever he wanted.[l] That was a huge mistake.
　From this point on, Tsubaki's family won't have enough savings.[l] She can't ask for an allowance from her parents, and she can't waste her money on her siblings anymore.
　The sweat dripping from her skin was assaulted by the snowy wind, bringing on a sudden chill.
“Onee-chan, let's go play kick-the-can.”
“No. It's too cold.”
　Tsubaki's hands shivered slightly.[l] Surely, the cold wasn't the reason.[l] It was a subconscious attempt at suppressing a dark impulse.[l] If she gave into that impulse, there'd be no turning back.
“Hey, let's play.”
“I said no.”
“If you play with me, I'll do whatever you say. So c'mon.”
　He reached out and placed the can directly in front of Tsubaki.[l] Tsubaki's darkness flowed into the container drop by drop.[l] It was about to overflow from within.
“Whatever I say?”
“Yeah.”
“Then you know what I'll say, right? I've already told you thousands of times.”
　She planned to put a stopper in her heart.[l] To close the doors ‘Maou’ had opened, Tsubaki asked her brother,
“You know what I'll say, right, Hiroaki?”
“What'll you say? Tell me. I love you, Sis, so I'll do it for sure. So you should play with me. After that, you think maybe we could go buy a puppy?”
　Now, for some reason, ‘Maou’ and Kyousuke's voices overlapped in Tsubaki's heart.
　――This child is hopeless.
　Together with their words, the dark droplets flowed out of the can before her.[l] A torrent burst forth.
　Hiroaki!
　Her impulse spiked dramatically.[l] Her raging palm screamed for violence, soaring through the wind.
　The can placed in front of her shot to the sky with a clear sound.[l] She was desperate.[l] Then, like waves lapping upon the shore, her palm firmly collided with her brother's face.
　Pain.[l] Her palm was moaning in pain.[l] Hiroaki's chubby cheek reddened.[l] She had always kissed him there, saying how cute he was.[l] Yet this time, she had hit him.[l] She had finally hit him.[l] There would be no turning back.[l] The Tsubaki of the past turned to ash as the sound of her sin echoed in the cold air.[l] The serious, straight-laced Tsubaki...[l] crumbled completely.
　It was a blow for disciplinary purposes.[l] She immediately formulated an excuse.[l] Because they were family, such actions would be forgiven.[l] Someone might even praise her for it.[l] Still, to Tsubaki, this was a tragedy akin to jumping from a skyscraper.
“Hiroaki...”
　Tsubaki, frightened, addressed her young brother.
　Hiroaki knelt on the floor, completely silent, like a marionette with severed strings.
“...Onee-chan.”
　The shock he suffered must be immeasurable.[l] Even the person who hit him nearly collapsed in regret.[l] To be treated violently by the sister he had always trusted would be entirely unfathomable.
“...Have we... started?”
　Hiroaki raised his head, obviously confused.
　Tsubaki's heart itself shook the air out of her lungs.[l] She could only hear that as him blaming her, ‘Why did you hit me?’
　The next moment, her brother's foolish smile met Tsubaki's eyes.
“Are we playing sumo wrestling, Sis...?”
　――I don't understand...
　Hiroaki didn't cry, but hugged Tsubaki's legs happily.
　Her brother's stainless smile disgusted her.[l] Seeing that familiar smile nauseated her.[l] Tsubaki lit a dark, raging fire of melancholy.[l] Once again letting her instincts guide her body, she struck her brother once more.[l] She crashed into his small chest, sinking her fist into his face.[l] She used all her strength to force him onto the ground.[l] She brought out all the brutality of a lifetime.
“Hehe, hehe...”
　But even when Hiroaki was covered in dirt, he still stood up with a smile, rubbing his knees.
　Why won't you cry?[l] What is it that makes you so happy?[l] Why is there no suspicion, no hatred, no tears?[l] Isn't it obvious that you're being beaten up?[l] This is no game.[l] I've already gone berserk, battering an insolent child.[l] I hate you.[l] Innocent, naive, free of suspicion... you make me so mad...!
“Onee-chan, let's keep plaaaying.”
　He drew the sentence out with a sweet voice.[l] His stretched cheeks were red and inflamed.[l] He looked up at her with an innocent, inquisitive look.
　Tsubaki's malicious cries wouldn't reach him, no matter what.[l] Is this kid that dumb?[l] How can he not understand?[l] Why, no matter how hard I hit him, does he still think it's a game?
“What, are we finished? Hey, Sis...?”
　Something welled up from Tsubaki's heart.
“Are you cold, Sis?”
　Tsubaki's naive brother concluded that his sister was cold.
“Why are you crying? Are you hurt? Did I overdo it?”
　Hiroaki made an honest, caring attempt from deep within his heart.[l] He looked at Tsubaki.
　And within those eyes, Tsubaki reached her limit.
　She finally understood.
　During her brother's growth, only people who loved him passed through his eyes.[l] He believes unconditionally that the sister who had poured nothing but endless, unconditional love onto him would never hurt him.
　Indeed, it was like a mirror.
“Hiroaki...!”
　Snowflakes danced in the air like cherry blossoms.[l] They fell softly onto Tsubaki's heart, cooling the flames.
...
......
That was a surprising scene.
I witnessed the conversation between Tsubaki and her brother from the sidelines.
“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... does it hurt...!?”
“Mm-mm, how about you, are you okay?”
“...I'm alright...”
“But, you're crying, right? Where does it hurt?”
“I'm okay, I'm sorry, there's really nothing wrong!”
Tsubaki must feel tortured by his impeccable trust.
“Onee-chan, is it my fault? Are you sad because I left home alone?”
Tsubaki weakly shook her head.
I taught Tsubaki this once before.
Let your emotions guide your body, let everything in your heart flow out.
“There was just something wrong with me...”
And this was the result.
No matter how spoiled he is, Tsubaki's brother was still Tsubaki's brother.
Tsubaki's whole family was so innocent and naive, you'd wonder if they were faking it.
“I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry, ah... I, I...”
“No, you didn't do anything wrong, Hiroaki... I'm the one who lied.”
“I didn't keep my promise with you, and I took the day off from school too. And I wasn't playing, I hit you because I was annoyed.”
“I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!”
Their tears fell together, like a reflection in a mirror.
A sudden ache erupted in my chest.
I finally understood what I had seen in Tsubaki all along.
It's not that she disgusts me, it's that she has what I've always yearned for.
I was deeply jealous of her innocence.
Thus, I wanted to destroy it.
...Damn.
We should have never crossed paths.
Tsubaki built such a wonderful thing with the strength of her heart. A thing I'll never have.
She built a steady home no wind could ever shake.
“I'll never come out by myself again.”
“Really...?”
“Yeah, because I want to be with you. You'll come out with me. You never say no when I ask for somethin', Sis.”
“...!”
A smile slowly emerged on Tsubaki's face.
“Thanks. I feel a lot more relaxed now.”
“I'll just be myself, Hiroaki.”
“Never suspecting anyone, never showing interest in money, having a passive approach to love...”
“And anyway, I have a family with me. When everyone else is hanging out downtown, I'll be kicking cans in the park with you, wearing those dull coats Dad buys for me...”
“That's how it should be, isn't it?”
“Isn't it, Hiroaki...?”
The snowfall grew heavier.
I forgot the work I came to do as I stood there, watching.
I couldn't suppress my feelings.
If I let these people influence me any further, I'll never be myself again.
Nevertheless, I can't deny that I want to take that final step.
How is the Miwa family going to face poverty after the move?
Can they continue to make fond memories in the face of a true problem――money?
After thinking about their uncertain future, my feelings became muddled.
I hope I'm not developing feelings for Tsubaki above the necessary level...
“......”
Should I go deeper...?
...
Is that okay?
I ask myself this question once more.
If I choose Tsubaki here, I feel like there'll be no turning back.
I have ambitions of my own.
Not to mention, I'm also curious about Usami and her relation to the fierce criminal calling himself ‘Maou’.
Even so, will I help Tsubaki?
“......”
I shouldn't affiliate myself with her anymore.
I gave up the idea of making her my assistant.
That girl has her own life to live.
Now that I've made my decision, I shouldn't hesitate anymore.
I can return her diary tomorrow.
I turned back and headed for the station.
Behind me, in the snow, two siblings played together joyfully.
......
...
I washed my face before going to sleep. My face reflected misfortune as I looked in the mirror.
Tsubaki made a fool out of me with this one...
Huh? A guest? But it's already ten o'clock...
I looked at the face behind the speaker, and suddenly became annoyed.
“Hiya.”
“What are you doing here?”
“Sorry to bother you, but could you lend me some soy sauce?”
“Soy sauce?”
“To tell the truth, I live nearby.”
“Yeah, right. There's no way you could afford an apartment around here.”
“No, it's true. An old friend lent me a room on the second floor of an office nearby.”
...True, there are a few houses with corporate inscriptions on the nameplates...
“Can I come in? Not that I have anything important to talk about.”
“Just go back to where you came from.”
“Cut me some slack, here. Not that I have anything important to talk about.”
“Hey, don't put your face so close to the camera. You're creating a pretty hilarious picture over here.”
“Now nobody's going to marry me anymore. Take responsibility and let me in!”
“...Christ, I get it, already. You have five minutes.”
I buzzed her in, and Usami walked in through the entrance with a victorious cheer.
I waited patiently for a few moments before the sound of footsteps outside prompted me to undo the chain and deadbolt.
“May I come in?”
“Don't poke your head out of a half-opened door, it's creepy...”
“Alrighty then...”
I didn't even hear Usami cross the threshold. She just managed to appear in the living room somehow.
“Well, spit it out. What's the matter?”
“Huh-?”
“I'm asking you about the reason for this sudden visit. If you have something to say, you can just call, you know?”
“Tsubaki just came over to my house.”
“...Nh... Tsubaki?”
“Oh? Do you have any secrets with Tsubaki? Sniff, sniff...”
“Don't smell the bed. You won't find anything.”
“I tell ya, it was quite a shock. Tsubaki suddenly bowed down and apologized to me at the door.”
“Hm. For her attitude lately?”
“Exactly. And at this hour, too. Apparently she went to the trouble to ask the school for my address.”
“Isn't that wonderful? You guys are friends again.”
“It was a relief for me too. Thinking back on it, saying, ‘The kid's back, so now let's go call the police,’ was pretty insensitive.”
“You changed your mind?”
“Indeed. Tsubaki was deathly afraid of the kidnapper's retaliation. It's not my problem, so it's not right for me to butt in.”
“Hmm.”
“Speaking of which, it's concern for your womanizing tendencies that has brought me over here tonight, you know.”
...I knew it, Tsubaki must have been jealous of Usami.
“So does the great ‘Maou’ know how to love?”
“I'm not ‘Maou’.”
“Still, I even took time off from my part-time job to search for ‘Maou's’ trail lately, and I don't even have a single lead.”
“Just give up then.”
“If I did that, my mom couldn't rest in peace.”
“Don't talk like she's dead.”
“Uwahaha.”
“It's not funny.”
“You really crack me up, Azai-san.”
After laughing for a while, Usami sporadically tensed up.
“I will catch the tail of this Devil.”
“Save that sharp look for him, then...”
Though I made a light joke, Usami's expression grew even harsher.
“About this kidnapping...”
“What?”
“Please listen to me carefully.”
“Um, ok?”
“One question I've yet to answer is, how did the kidnapper take the stocks in the briefcase?”
“Does it really matter anymore?”
“Nah, probably not. Anyway, I wanted to keep this bit to myself, but I think there's something you should know.”
“What for?”
“So I can give one of those ‘I've already seen through all your tricks!’ speeches.”
...And why am I the one on the receiving end of it, pray tell?
“Like I said, save it for ‘Maou’.”
“Eh, too much trouble. Just listen, if you would.”
Realizing it was meaningless to continue fooling around with her, I shut my mouth for the moment.
“First of all, why did ‘Maou’ want the ransom in the form of stocks?”
“We've discussed this before. The main reason is easy transport.”
“But, if so, there are other forms of legal tender which would suffice... for example, checks would work just fine.”
I cut in.
“But when a check is cashed, it leaves a trail, doesn't it?”
“Yes. However, so do stocks. The corporation gives every share a pin number, and using this pin, the police could find out who bought or sold the correlated shares immediately.”
“True. In novels, the kidnapper usually asks for old bills with unsequential serial numbers instead of checks or stocks in order to decrease the risk.”
Of course, there are shady merchants in every trade. There are quite a few people one could sell to through a friendly third party broker. Naturally, the police would have those places marked and would probably still be able to track you down as a suspect.
“In my opinion, obtaining fifty million yen wasn't ‘Maou's’ goal.”
“I've thought about that too. If he only wanted money, he wouldn't have kidnapped Hiroaki.”
“Which means ‘Maou’ likely never planned to cash the shares he got from Tsubaki's family. What could this mean?”
She asked me this with a suspicious look.
“Rather than desiring the money for himself, he wanted Tsubaki's family to lose it?”
“The possibility of that is very high. Thus, I think he knew about the crash beforehand, and that's why he specified which stock he wanted.”
“You're saying he knew?”
“Remember teaching me about this, Azai-san? You told me that anyone affiliated with Sannou Corporation would have known about the price drop.”
“Yeah...”
I learned that from Gonzou, though.
“‘Maou’ did that to ensure that, whether or not he was able to obtain the ransom, Tsubaki's family would still be right where he wanted them.”
“If your theory is correct, this guy is freakishly cautious. Wouldn't that mean that the moment Tsubaki's family used the money they got from their loan to buy shares, it was already ‘Maou's’ victory?”
“And yet ‘Maou’ still played out a huge drama the next day to snatch the ransom, successfully taking the shares in the end.”
“That's where it gets confusing, huh?”
“I think ‘Maou’ saw that day as an excuse to ‘have some fun’.”
“Have some fun?”
I tilted my head in confusion.
“‘Maou’ accomplished his goal of taking the Miwa family's shares, and at the same time, he played a game with me.”
“Hey now, you make it sound like this ‘Maou’ guy was pretty sure of himself. He could've been caught by the police at any time.”
“That's probably why he used the shares as a form of insurance. That way, he could have his fun without having to worry about putting his main goal in jeopardy. If anything happened midway, ‘Maou’ would probably have given up on the kidnapping and vanished into the fog.”
“Whatever the case, he's a maniac, which is why I have to ask...”
It's my turn to ask questions.
“Why is ‘Maou’ playing this game with you?”
“As I said before, I think ‘Maou’ is testing me.”
“That's what I'm asking, why would he test a strange girl like you?”
“Because I'm one of the few that know of ‘Maou's’ existence and his past crimes.”
Usami's eyes narrowed.
“Also... I think ‘Maou’ hates me as much as I hate him.”
I clicked my tongue.
“You're not going to tell me the details, are you?”
“Sorry.”
She stuck her tongue out.
“Alright, fine. Let's get back to business.”
“Sure. So, how did ‘Maou’ get the ransom?”
“Wasn't the theory that I copied the coin locker's key beforehand?”
I stared at her, and Usami smiled.
“Wasn't that what happened?”
“True enough, you asked me to keep an eye on the lockers for a while.”
“Right?　You could've easily just opened the locker with a copied key during that time.”
“There's a surveillance camera in the locker bay, isn't there? You should be able to see me taking the ransom if you watch the tapes.”
“That was pretty stupid of you then, Azai-san.”
“Enough. I can't prove your idea wrong, but you should come up with another theory.”
“Another theory?”
“What would be the most plausible way to snatch the ransom?”
Usami nodded deeply.
“...I've got an idea, but there's no evidence.”
“It's okay, say it. All your rudeness may be forgiven after you tell me.”
“Thanks, I appreciate it.”
Her smile cut off immediately, and her eyebrows moved up.
“I only noticed it after the incident ended, and it really got on my nerves...”
“That day, there was something strange about the kidnapper's requests...”
Usami raised a finger.
“The kidnapper feared the interference of the authorities, correct?”
“Yeah...”
I nodded, remembering what I heard from Tsubaki.
“‘Maou’ only wanted to play a game with me. He never considered facing the police. If he'd seen even a trace of a patrol car, the trade would've been called off right away.”
“I thought as much too...”
Suddenly, a light-bulb turned on in my head, and my eyes went round.
“Wait, that can't be right...”
“And why would you think that?”
“I'm not sure about the details, but Tsubaki was questioned by a passing policeman at one point.”
“Yes. It was in the high class residential area of the Southern District.”
“Is that a coincidence... or...?”
I stopped abruptly.
“Eh-...?”
As if someone had grabbed my throat, I couldn't continue my sentence.
“That's right, Azai-san.”
“‘Maou’ probably took the ransom from the briefcase――”
“――right in front of Tsubaki's eyes.”
“‘Maou’, who originally feared the police, disguised himself as the police.”
“The ‘coincidental’ police interview, his intentional agitating of Tsubaki all day, the ruckus all over the city... they were all traps.”
“Don't you think it's strange?”
“Tsubaki escaped without answering their questions, right? It's amazing there was no major fuss. But even if nothing major was caused, it's hard to imagine that cautious ‘Maou’ letting Tsubaki go and continuing the trade.”
“If we follow through with this to the end, all the pieces begin to match up.”
“Why did ‘Maou’ tell us to put the shares in a briefcase?”
“The shares by themselves are already convenient enough to carry around, so why would he go out of his way to order them into a bulky briefcase? It kept bothering me as I followed Tsubaki around.”
“But now that I think back, it's really ridiculous. I hate myself for not realizing it earlier.”
“‘Maou’ should have been wary about the police, but he let Tsubaki carry a suitcase that clearly made her stand out. He even chose the Southern District's residential area for the exchange, an area that the police patrol frequently.”
“It wasn't until after the incident was already over that I figured it out.”
“He chose a huge, black suitcase so people would think it's normal for the police to come up and ask about it.”
“It fooled me into thinking that, at least. It didn't feel out of the ordinary at all.”
“After all, if you came across a suspicious vehicle parked right on the road in a high class residential area like the Southern District, it's only natural to think a patrolling policeman might knock on the window.”
“I was totally fooled into believing that Tsubaki was caught by the police because of her bad luck.”
“There were two officers. One questioned the panicked Tsubaki, and the other, probably a friend of ‘Maou’, searched the car. He most likely opened the suitcase and took the shares at that time.”
“Tsubaki probably doesn't remember the policeman's face or voice. ‘Maou’ was, without a doubt, well aware of just what state of mind Tsubaki was in back then.”
“Then again, I don't have room to talk. I should've paid more attention to the police myself.”
“After all this time, I only remember that they pulled their caps down, and one of them had a long nose. I got the impression that he was a foreigner.”
“That was probably the most critical moment of the whole event to ‘Maou’. It wouldn't have been unheard of for real police to show up there.”
“A few days ago, I pretended to have lost my way and went to the police station with this idea in mind. From what I saw, it seemed that the patrol times are fixed. It's possible that ‘Maou’ researched these details himself.”
“I asked around too, and the police in that station didn't patrol in a team of two anytime recently.”
Usami's piercing eyes forced a touch of caution into my next statement.
“...I see, so you do at least have some backing to your theory.”
“Mm... but it's only a guess, mind you.”
Usami frowned again.
“If we don't catch ‘Maou’, then this is pointless.”
Her eyes grew even more piercing and profound than before.
“‘Maou’... he made Tsubaki... dragged Tsubaki into this when she didn't have anything to do with it.”
A frightening glare, filled with resentment.
“That's unforgivable... wouldn't you agree, Azai-san――――?”
I stood against Usami's attention, and provoked her with my own glare in return.
“Unforgivable, Usami――”
For some reason, my heart was calm.
I unknowingly took on a dignified attitude. It was almost like there was something inside of me accepting her challenge, and at the same time, showing enough confidence to say that she was not a threat.
What if, as she claims... I'm ‘Maou’?
Though I knew for sure it couldn't be true, a small voice somewhere laughed and said it wasn't so bad, either.
