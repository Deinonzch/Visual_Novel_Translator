　It's only late October, yet one can already feel the brisk northern wind blowing by. The road gradually loses its color with the setting of the sun. At the corner of a large building, inside an empty alleyway, pieces of fallen leaves dance elegantly in the wind. Narrowing their eyes to prevent dust from blowing in, the people on the street scurry to their homes.
　‘Maou’ raised his eyebrows as he watched the passing pedestrians, as if sensing the coming of winter. His long period of translucence was coming to an end.
　To perform a white-collar crime, one must both meticulously conceive and boldly execute a perfect plan. The time, place, and necessary sacrifices must be thoroughly thought out beforehand. In order to achieve this perfection, ‘Maou’ had spent many years in planning.
　‘Maou’ wishes to kindle a power struggle within this city; a struggle to control the oceans of common men. And just as the water in these oceans will always flow downward, the weak will always surge forward by the will of the strong. Therefore, to rule these seas of men, he will simply have to use overwhelming power. Yet if it becomes necessary in achieving his objectives, ‘Maou’ will not hesitate to interrupt this torrential current. A sane man would probably dismiss his motives, believing them to be mere justifications of his criminal acts. Still, even though people call him a devil, there are some that share his beliefs.
　As proof, ‘Maou’ had already found both the necessary money and ‘children’ to work as his underlings. These children――young adults, really――are not simply crucial actors in the upcoming criminal performance, but also his loyal followers.
　――The battle will soon begin.
　My father, my father, the “Devil” is out there――
　Walking on a busy, flourishing street, the young girl felt awed by the sight. When she was a child, the streets did not have four lanes, and the buildings were not as high as mountains. However, in this day and age, her sighs disappeared quickly amidst the sounds of people walking through the intersection.
　The girl carried a worn brown suitcase. Within the suitcase lies an expertly crafted violin. Granted, its market value was nothing compared to a legendary instrument, like a Stradivarius, but this violin was the girl's most prized possession.
　She squeezed the handle tightly as her body gorged on emotion.
　Her mother's memento.
　Remembering her mother's death, her heart began to burn. Within herself, with immutable confidence, lies an unwavering desire to fight. The girl kicks off the ground with incredible force.
　She will never give up. Not until she's accomplished her goal.
　Not until she defeats the “Devil” with her own hands...
“......”
I wake up at seven every morning.
Breakfast is always milk with toast.
And like every other day, I opened today's newspaper.
But despite all that routine, it's only after looking through my huge window and observing a city with more than ten million residents that I finally start to feel ready for the day.
Now, it's time for school.
After everything I had to take care of these past three days, school seems much more interesting.
Well, I'm ready to go.
...Huh?
A visitor this early in the morning?
I don't remember making any appointments...
“Hello...?”
The face on the screen looks familiar.
“Umm... is this the Azai residence?”
“Excuse me, but who are you?”
“Oh, umm... I'm Miwa. Miwa Tsubaki.”
“......”
“I'm Azai Kyousuke-kun's classmate... well, the class representative.”
“Ah... that Tsubaki.”
“Eh? Azai-kun?”
“Yeah, it's me. Didn't you notice?”
Modern intercoms shouldn't have any signal quality issues.
“You sounded different. I thought it might be your father.”
“Hah. Well, don't worry about it, I apparently forgot you too.”
“Eh? You're kidding, right? Haven't we been in the same class since our first year?”
...No, I'm not kidding.
It seems that I'm not fully awake yet.
“Anyways, why are you here?”
“Well, you've been sick these past few days, right? So I was like... wondering what happened to you...”
“Everything's fine now. Tell you what, I'll be right down. Let's walk to school together.”
“A-alright!”
Tsubaki sounded pretty happy.
“Morning.”
Tsubaki is one of those persons that improves your spirit by just being around her.
“This is the first time I've seen where you live. It's so amazing.”
“Amazing?”
“Isn't this one of those luxury apartments? I've seen them on TV before. They say only rich people live in these complexes.”
“Well, I guess it is a bit big for just one person.”
“What!? You live alone?”
“I'm a man of wealth and taste, after all.”
I smile wryly.
“You live in the Eastern District, right?”
“Yup. The city here is really modernized, but there's nothing but fields out by me...”
“Then it should be nice and quiet, right?”
“Well, but a lot of foreigners showed up recently, so it's a little more busy than usual these days.”
“They're building a ski resort out there, right? People rave about the snow quality, I hear, so it's been getting a lot of publicity in Australia. Supposedly it's going to be quite the tourist attraction.”
“Ah, yeah.”
“The value of real estate out there is about 140,000 yen per square-yard, right? But then again, the developers are using a general contractor, so no matter how many hotels and restaurants they build, it won't benefit the residents too much...”
“Uh, mmhmm...”
“......”
...There's no point in talking to Tsubaki about this.
“You seem kinda rich.”
“I'm a man of wealth and taste, after all.”
“I'm writing this in my diary: Azai-kun is rich...”
Tsubaki holds the red book to her chest, as if it were a treasure.
“That diary is like a part of your skin. Is there some specific reason you carry it around all day?”
“Writing, writing.”
“Listen to me!”
“I arrived at Azai-kun's apartment at seven in the morning. It's unbelievably swanky. Today is a beautiful day. Period.”
“...We'd better hurry to school.”
We finally began our trek to school together.
After a short fifteen minute walk, we arrived before the gates.
“This school is known as the ‘Jiyuuga Saki’ School. As its name suggests, the school advocates freedom for its students. Many unique students attend here. There are even quite a few artisans and idols.”
“On the other hand, students here can easily graduate even if they don't concentrate on their academics. That's why many people think this is just a flimsy art school with no substance.”
“You know, Azai-kun's often absent from class. His sister's gone a lot too, but that's because she has to participate in figure skating competitions. But Azai-kun should be like me, just a regular student.”
“Mmmm, Azai-kun is a mysterious person, isn't he...? Period.”
...I don't really understand what's going on, but apparently the explanation of the school is over.
“Hey, Tsubaki.”
“Oh, sorry. Was I muttering out loud?”
“About my absences... didn't I tell you about that before?”
“Oh. It was because of illness, right?”
“That's not what I said.”
Tsubaki tilted her head.
“I'm absent because I help my Papa with work. Sometimes I even take business trips out of the country.”
“This is the first time I've heard you say this.”
“Really?”
“I swear. I'm certain of it, because I write everything I know about you in my diary.”
“Somehow that sounded a bit creepy...”
“But I just heard something good. Lemme write it down...”
“You're writing this down, too?”
“Azai-kun calls his father ‘Papa’... the way Westerners do. Period.”
“What's wrong with that? Even Honekawa-san says it like that.”
“Honekawa-san...? Oh, the guy in that anime?”
“Honekawa-san is my idol.”
...Hmm. I think I'm starting to get in the groove.
“Good morning!”
“Oh, hey, Eiichi.”
“That is Aizawa Eiichi-kun. As you can see, he's your typical pretty-boy. He wears shorts even in the winter. He's very popular among older women, and also a good friend of mine. Period.”
...I'm once again in the dark here, but apparently she's done explaining the new character, too.
“Gosh, the temperature just keeps dropping. Last night, I even got to hoping it would snow today.”
A cute, puppy-like smile appeared on his face.
“Hey, hey, Tsubaki-chan... did you read the new issue of CUNCUN yesterday?”
CUNCUN is a popular women's fashion magazine.
“No, not yet.”
“How about I lend it to you, then? This month they ran a special on perfumes. Oh, and one of the columns mentioned the new candy store in the Western District.”
Eiichi knows a lot about popular women's topics.
“Eiichi-kun, don't take this the wrong way, but you're even cuter than me.”
“Ehehe, so you think I'm feminine?”
“That's a good thing, though. It makes you really easy to talk to.”
“Well, thank you～!”
I think this every time, but Eiichi's smile always looks perfect.
“Oh, I almost forgot.”
Eiichi once again flashes his bright white teeth.
“I heard there will be a transfer student starting today.”
“In our class?”
At this time of year...?
She's probably some new idol who moved here for her debut. It's not that unusual for one to transfer here in the middle of the school year.
“It's a girl. I hope she's a cute one.”
“I just hope she comes to class every day. People are so busy towards the end of the year, so there's no one to talk to in class...”
“I think Kanon is coming today.”
“Oh, really? She's already back from the US?”
“Canada, actually. I just got the message last night.”
“She's really something else. She might even make the next Olympics.”
“Well, that all depends on how she does between now and then.”
“So, Kanon-chan's back... I really want to see her again...”
It sounds like she's waiting for her lover.
...What a sweet girl.
“Oh, I almost forgot. The teacher asked me to see her this morning.”
“Now that's the kind of stuff you should remember to write in your diary.”
“Sorry, I've got to go.”
“See you later.”
Tsubaki dashed into the school building.
“......”
“......”
Eiichi and I stared at each other for a while.
“Dammit...!”
“Wh-, what?”
“Damn that little bitch...”
“Huh?”
“What's with that, ‘Don't take this the wrong way, but you're even cuter than me,’ bullshit!? What was she trying to imply!?”
“Oh, come on. She didn't mean anything bad by it.”
“Me, cute? Don't be ridiculous.”
“Dude, what the hell? You were laughing with her, weren't you...?”
“I'm so fucking pissed. If I were two years younger, I would totally mount her ass.”
“Whoa, kid... she's our friend, right? If you've gotta think about screwing her, at least think about doing it gently.”
“Friend, family, whatever man, it doesn't even fucking matter! I'm a fucking sight to see when I snap, man. I just kill everyone in sight.”
...What an idiot.
Finally, the bell rings.
“Heheh, I guess I'll be fooling around with those stupid sluts again today...”
“Aizawa-kun, please hurry to the classroom.”
“Yes, coming!”
...That was an incredibly fast personality switch...
There are about thirty students in this class. Five are absent today.
“Shiratori-san didn't come today...”
“Are you good friends with Shiratori-san?”
“Not really... why do you ask?”
“Well... I'd kind of like to be her friend, too.”
“That's great.”
Shiratori... Shiratori Mizuha... even though I forget a lot of stuff, that's one girl that I need to take note of.
Unfortunately, she's not here today...
Then, I realized how noisy the hallway was.
“What's going on?”
“Goooood morning!”
“Oh, Kanon-chan!”
The classroom immediately became livelier following Kanon's arrival.
“Heya! How is everyone?”
Sweet stepsister, you really are quite loud.
“Long time no see, Kanon-chan. How was Canada?”
“Huh? Canada?”
“Well...”
“......”
“It felt like Canada～.”
Sweet stepsister, you really are quite airheaded.
“I, I see...”
“But, but, I learned the quad jump there!”
She has a smug look on her face.
“Amazing～! I heard that only a few people in the world can execute a quad jump!”
“But, but, I fall down on my butt when I land～!”
She still has a smug look on her face.
“I, I see...”
“Nii-san, Nii-san!”
“What? Why are you so excited?”
“Can I spend the night at your place today?”
“Huh?”
I was stunned for a second.
“Ahh... so it's started back up already. Kanon-chan's acting like a spoiled kid again.”
“Kanon-chan really loves her brother...”
“So, can I, can I?”
“Hold it right there. Today's a bad day.”
Well, any day's a bad day...
“Why?”
“Don't keep looking at me with those eyes...”
“Why, why, why? What's the problem?”
“Kyousuke, she's got you cornered...”
I think I just saw an evil smile pop up on Eiichi's face.
“Why? Because there's only one bed in my house!”
“So? We can sleep together.”
Hey, now...
“I think you're missing something here. Think about it. A non-blood-related brother and sister sharing the same bed? What is this, some third rate soap opera?”
“Huh?”
“Right, Eiichi? You tell her.”
“I... I'm too innocent to know about things like that...”
...Asshole.
“Look, you just can't. Go back home like you normally do. Papa wants to see you, too.”
“Don't wanna.”
“Now what...?”
But just at that moment, as if God had intervened, my cell phone rang.
“Oh, Azai-kun. You can't carry a cell phone in school. I told you, it's...”
I ignored her and answered the phone.
“Hello...?”
“Oh. Hi, Miki-chan! I had a lot of fun at the park the other day.”
“Huh?”
“Eh?”
“Yeah, I'm at school right now... what? Really? You want to do it again sometime? So do I...”
“...Who is it?”
“His friend, right? Azai-kun seems to have a lot of friends outside of school.”
“Kyousuke-kun's so popular, isn't he? What a lucky guy.”
“Hmm...?”
“...Sure. I'll call you again later. Alright, bye.”
After the conversation, I looked at Kanon.
“Who was it?”
“Just a little friend of mine.”
“Little?”
“She's your girlfriend?”
“Well, not exactly. It's hard to describe my relationship with Miki-chan...”
“Now I'm mad. While I was in Canada, you changed into a completely different person.”
“C'mon now, don't be like that. You know what they say. You're supposed to have fun while you're young.”
“So you were just ‘having fun’ with her!? I never knew you were such a heartless person!”
“Az-... Azai-kun has a girlfriend? I didn't know at all...”
“No, that wasn't my girlfriend...”
“I didn't know about it, either. Hey, introduce her to us next time.”
“You better watch your back, Nii-san.”
“W-what for...?”
“Whatever, I don't care anymore!”
Turning her head, she sulked back to her seat.
“Wow, that's a shock. Azai-kun already has a girlfriend. Period.”
“Haha...”
School really is great. It's so... comfortable.
“Hey, Eiichi.”
“What now?”
“Class is going to start without the transfer student.”
Eiichi is sitting at the back of the class, reading a magazine instead of his textbook.
“...Hmmm, that's strange.”
“Are you sure she's coming today?”
“I heard it from Noriko-chan, so it's definitely legit.”
Noriko-chan is a teacher at this school. Supposedly she's in some sort of relationship with Eiichi, but I doubt it.
“Why? You interested?”
“I'm always interested in women.”
“‘I'm always interested in women.’ God, man, quit pitching your tent in school.”
“Well, it's tough being a transfer student, right? She won't know her way around school. She might have trouble making friends. You know what I'm talking about.”
“So?”
“So she'll be easy to seduce.”
“You really are Mr. Hyde.”
“I don't really want to hear that from you, but I'll take it as a compliment.”
When it comes to women, Eiichi and I have always seen eye to eye.
“Oh, Kyousuke. Have you seen my pencil?”
Eiichi looks all over his desk for it.
“You ever hear of a guy named Newton?”
“Who?”
“Isaac Newton.”
“I'm Aizawa Eiichi.”
“Yes. Yes, you are. Your pencil is under your desk.”
“Who's Isaac?”
“A famous person.”
“Like some new mobile suit or something?”
“No, he's a famous physicist.”
“My favorite famous person is Fukuzawa Yukichi.”
“Because you like money?”
“No way, Bro. Don't you just think he's totally cool?”
“How is he cool? Would you mind sharing with the class?”
“He was like an amazingly fair person, and he said a lot of amazing things. He was totally amazing.”
“The only thing I understood was that you overused the word ‘amazing’.”
“Whatever. The guy was fucking amazing.”
...If an ad agency ever hired Eiichi, he'd run them into the ground.
“Of course, I also love money.”
“So it's about money, after all...”
“Oh, I guess class ended while we were talking. Even though this happens every time, our classes really are failing more every day, aren't they～?”
...Fukuzawa Yukichi?
“......”
...Fuck you zawa.
It's still October, so the rooftop is quite cold...
“Aren't you going to eat, Kanon-chan?”
“I'm on a diet.”
For figure skaters, it seems that even one extra pound could cause balance problems during jumps.
“Are you just eating junk food again, Eiichi-kun?”
“Well, I can survive off of chocolate alone.”
I don't know if it's part of his ‘innocent’ image, but I've never seen him eat anything but sweets.
“Azai-kun is... talking on his cell phone...”
Even during breaks, I need to spend my time on the phone.
“Uuh... looks like I'll be eating alone again.”
Tsubaki sadly opened her lunch box and began to eat.
“Haah...”
“Oh, you've finished talking?”
“Who was on the phone?”
Seems like Kanon's mood hasn't improved since this morning.
“Don't get the wrong impression. I was just calling your new maid, Kanon.”
“Maid?”
“Yeah. Her name is Kojima. She's a very affable person.”
“Why did you get me a maid?”
“Papa asked me to. He said the house will be a lot noisier after you're back.”
“Oh, I getcha. Since I have practice today, I'll be back home late. If I see her I'll be sure to say hi!”
“Where does your family live?”
“In the Southern District.”
Tsubaki looked bewildered.
“Wait, then why do you live by yourself?”
“To be closer to school! Right, Nii-san?”
“Well, I'm really out of it in the mornings...”
Eiichi whispered beside me.
“Ha... more like it's so you can bring women back.”
“Eh? Did you say something, Eiichi-kun?”
“Mmmm. Chocolate tastes sooo good!”
One of these days I'm going to teach this kid a lesson he'll never forget.
“Huh?”
I pointed at that person without thinking.
“What?”
“Wow, her hair is so long.”
More like it's very thick.
“......”
She's staring at us.
Well, I guess you could say we're staring at her too, but she's been staring at us for a while now.
To be more precise, she'd been staring at me...
“Who is she? I've never seen her before.”
“That's because you don't usually come to school.”
“So, you know who she is?”
“No, I don't.”
“Hmmm. You think she's an underclassman?”
At that moment, Eiichi raised his hand excitedly.
“Oh, I got it! I got it!”
“Got what?”
“The true identity of the girl with the long hair!”
He has a smug look on his face.
My cell phone rang.
“Oh, sorry...”
“Another call again!”
“Don't get mad. It's the same person.”
“Oh, the maid?”
I answered the phone.
On the other end of the line is an old lady's voice.
“Oh, hi. You're Kojima-san, right...?”
Dammit, Kanon is annoying sometimes.
She's been following me around since we were kids...
“I think I'm the only person in this school without a cell phone.”
“It's not like they enforce the rules here.”
“Listen to me!”
It seems Eiichi really wants to tell us something about the girl with the long hair.
“Hmm...”
After giving the maid some simple directions, I hung up the phone.
“Hey...”
A voice spoke up from behind me.
“Huh?”
I turned around. A pair of large eyes stared at me from behind a long, thick, living creature of hair.
“It was a lie, wasn't it?”
“Huh?”
Eyes so clear that one could fall into them.
“You said she was an affable person, right?”
I saw a faint smile form in the corner of her lips.
“So? What are you trying to say?”
“You said the maid was a affable person, but the next time you picked up the phone, you said, ‘You're Kojima-san, right...?’”
I kept my mouth shut.
“In other words, that was the first time you talked to the maid called Kojima. If so, how do you know she's an affable person?”
“......”
“Conclusion: you were not talking to the maid the first time.”
Who is this girl...?
“Uhm, Azai-kun? This is...?”
“Huh? Huh?”
These two still don't get it...
“Am I invisible or something!? I said listen to me!”
Wait, make that three...
“I'm not sure what you're trying to imply, but the person who recommended her told me about her affable personality.”
“I see...”
Can it be? Is this weird girl...?
“She's the transfer student!”
“......”
The transfer student who was late on her first day stands before the class.
“......”
She keeps looking down at the floor.
“Alright, would you care to introduce yourself?”
As the class representative, Tsubaki organized this introduction.
“Eh?”
“You don't have to be nervous. How about telling us your name, first?”
“Ah, haah...”
She doesn't seem to be motivated.
“My... name...?”
She muttered in a voice that was hard to pick up.
“She's a weird girl, isn't she?”
“Her hair is so long.”
“She's got a strange air about her...”
Feeling awkward, Tsubaki tried to ask again.
“Yeah, your name...”
“...Do I... do I really have to say it?”
“Well, sure you do! If you didn't, we wouldn't know what to call you, would we?”
“Haah... indeed.”
She keeps sighing.
“I am... Bin Laden.”
“W-what!?”
“You don't know that name?”
She seems to be quite angry.
“What in...? She's sooo weird.”
“Her hair's sooo long.”
Beads of sweat appeared on Tsubaki's forehead.
“Look... please just...”
“My name, right...?”
“Y-yeah...”
“I used to be called Hero.”
“Huh? Hero?”
“I mean like, if you had people say, ‘Hey, Hero. Go buy some hero bread,’ or something like that, it'd just crack you up, right?”
“Uh, Usami-san... you can stop...”
“Didn't I just say that you should call me Usami Bin Laden?”
“Eh?”
“Ah, crap, a pun.”
“Ahaha. I just made a pun.”
“Argh, I should shoot myself...”
“......”
“...Oh, and I play the violin, in case you're interested...”
“Ah. Oh, yes...”
So she finally wants to introduce herself.
“You know, when a musician gets arrested, the media calls them strange names. Like, ‘This morning, we apprehended the vocalist Satoh.’ Don't you think ‘vocalist Satoh’ sounds really weird?”
“My last name is Usami. If I'm ever on the news, would they call me ‘violinist Usami’?”
“And what if the criminal is a piccolo player? Then would it be ‘Piccoloist Usami’? I mean we're already talking about someone who did bad things and got arrested... adding Piccolo to their name is just overkill.”
“......”
“......”
“......”
No one in the class responded.
“Haah...”
There she goes sighing again.
“Well, everyone...”
“Even though I'm usually depressed, please be friendly towards me. Then maybe you'll see my cute side.”
“My name is Usami Haru...”
I'm worn out already...
Usami Haru, huh...?
Is she some new comedian?
There's a pop quiz in math class this afternoon.
Apparently, it's a test that could affect my whole life.
“Ahh... this is so hard...”
Kanon mumbles to herself while tapping her head.
“......”
The mysterious transfer student, Usami Haru, is sitting in front of me.
Her posture is perfect.
Her back is perfectly straight as she writes down the answers.
“Hey, Kyousuke...”
Eiichi whispered to me.
“The transfer student is writing weird things on her paper.”
That's right, Eiichi can see her paper from his angle.
“What did she write?”
“No idea, but I saw the word ‘kingdom’.”
“Huh?”
This isn't a history test.
“What the...? ‘The United Nations vs. Me?’”
“Wait, what are you talking about?”
“No, not me. The transfer student...”
Eiichi has a blank look on his face.
“She's drawing something. Is that a... a penguin? The name of the penguin is... Perry. Special technique: the opening of a country to the global economy... what kinda penguin from Hell is that...?”
“N-, now you got me interested...”
“Hey...”
Suddenly, Usami turned around.
“Don't look.”
“Eh?”
“You saw them, didn't you?”
“No, I...”
“This is a very important proposal.”
“Pro-... proposal?”
She had a sharp look in her eye.
“Oh, are you sketching up ideas for character merchandise or something? Or maybe for a game or something...?”
“It's not something as childish as that.”
Childish...
“Then, what is it?”
“Not telling.”
“I see.”
I have no idea how, but it seems like I angered Usami.
“......”
“......”
“...You're not curious in the least bit?”
“No, not really...”
“Well, fine, then...”
For some reason, she seems depressed now.
“......”
“What?”
As if appraising an item, she examined me closely.
At this point, the bell rang.
“It's finally over... I didn't understand one bit of that.”
“Kanon-chan, you shouldn't talk during tests.”
Everyone's finally relaxed now that the test is over.
“Hey...”
Eiichi used his cute voice again as he came over to Usami and me.
“......”
“Hi, I'm Aizawa Eiichi.”
“......”
“Usami-san, your hair's so fluffy and thick. It's really, really pretty! Which salon do you usually go to?”
“......”
Usami doesn't say anything and continues staring at Eiichi.
“What is it? I get cosmetic treatments sometimes, too, even though I'm a guy. But these days, I think it's important for men to pay attention to their appearance too.”
“Cosmetic treatments?”
“Right. Cosmetic treatments.”
“At a beauty salon?”
“Yeah... oh wait, you just moved to this city, so you wouldn't know the best places to go here yet.”
“Yeah, I've got no idea.”
“Then let me tell you. There's a salon downtown that hired a really famous stylist recently. Lots of celebrities go there.”
“Mmm.”
...She doesn't seem interested.
“Usami-san?”
Tsubaki came over with a smile on her face.
“Sorry about earlier. I couldn't give you a proper introduction.”
Tsubaki is such a pleasant girl.
“I'm so sorry. I'm a terrible class representative. You were probably nervous as heck, right?”
Tsubaki is such a kind girl.
“Do you think we could talk a bit more before we go home?”
“I think I'd rather go home now.”
“Hauu!”
Critical hit.
“...Ahaha, why not stay for just a few minutes?”
“Sorry, Etekichi-san.”
“It's Eiichi.”
“I apologize.”
“Why are you being so formal?”
“This is the way we speak in my hometown. I'm not from here.”
“Oh, you're from someplace far away. It must have been a tough trip.”
“Where are you from?”
“Huh?”
“...I asked you where you're from.”
“Ah...”
“The North Pole?”
“Don't be ridiculous. Nobody lives there.”
“Then the South Pole?”
“Stop using such extreme places.”
“‘Extreme’, huh? I guess that word was made for times like these.”
“...W-why are you saying that like you won something...?”
“Look, I'm really sorry, but...”
“Ah, sorry for holding you up.”
“......”
“Hm? What is it?”
“Could it be that you want to be my friend?”
“...Why the sudden change in attitude?”
“Do you want to?”
“Y-yes, yes. Let's all be friends.”
“How about starting tomorrow?”
“Huh? Starting tomorrow?”
“I haven't mentally prepared myself today.”
“So you need preparation. I see...”
“Yeah, sorry. Bye now.”
Usami quickly got up and left.
“Haah...”
“Yeah, I'm right there with you Bro...”
Eiichi and I look at each other.
“Yay! Now I'm friends with Usami-san!”
Tsubaki, on the otherhand, was all smiles.
“Nii-san, Non-chan has practice so I'll be leaving at mach speed.”
Whenever Kanon's in a good mood, she calls herself Non-chan.
“You'll be practicing until ten tonight, like usual, right?”
“You have to come watch me.”
“I plan to. I want to see Mama, too.”
‘Mama’ is Kanon's mother.
But beyond that, she's also Kanon's figure skating coach.
“Come by around seven. We can eat dinner at rinkside!”
She clings to my arm.
“Okay? Okay?”
She swings my arm around.
Kanon has always used expressive body language.
“I got it. Seven o'clock, right...?”
“Heehee. Awesome～!”
She buries her face in my chest.
“...Wait a minute. We're at school, people will see us...”
“Non-chan doesn't care.”
“Oh, well. You were always like this...”
Well, it's because she's like this that she can perform in front of an audience.
“Well, see ya!”
She did a little jump and left.
“Oh, Azai-kun.”
“What is it?”
“Are you going home?”
“Yeah.”
“Ah, I see... I see.”
“Huh?”
“Ah, well, um...”
Tsubaki seems nervous.
“...What is it?”
“A-... are you free right now?”
“Well, I guess so...”
“Oh, really...? Uhhh... hold on a sec.”
“Stop looking through your diary. What do you need?”
“S-... so do you want to go out somewhere with me?”
...So she just wants to go out.
“Sure. But only until six. I have an appointment with Kanon later tonight.”
“Oh, yeah, that's no problem. It's not good for me to get home too late, either.”
“We're just hanging out. Why all the fuss?”
“Because inviting you somewhere after school makes me nervous, Azai-kun.”
“Is that so?”
“You always seem rushed to go home, right? So I always thought you must be busy.”
“You don't have to worry too much about that...”
“But this is so great. Now we can be even better friends.”
Tsubaki smiled innocently.
She really is a sweet girl.
It's almost November, so the sun is starting to set early these days.
“Oh?”
“Isn't that Eiichi-kun?”
Eiichi's standing by the school gate, talking to a female teacher.
“What's he doing?”
“I don't know. But it sure looks like he's into that teacher.”
“Ah, I see... so Eiichi-kun likes older women?”
“And then, get this, Miss Noriko...”
And apparently, he's trying to make a pass at her.
“I'm raising a rabbit now～.”
“How cute.”
“Its name is ‘Jumpy’. Cute name, right?”
“Yes, yes. Very cute.”
That's so disgusting...
“Oh, yeah. You also have a puppy, right?”
“Yeah, a Maltese. It's so cute.”
“Very cute.”
“I also have some fish at home. Oh, and a parrot too.”
Eiichi's house is a regular zoo.
“If you have time, how about coming by and taking a look?”
“...You mean go to your home?”
“Yeah, we can have dinner together. I'm a really good cook.”
“Hmmm. I have after-school duties this week, so I'd be getting there pretty late. What do you think?”
“It's no problem, come on over. I won't do anything strange.”
“Anything strange?”
“Huh? Uh, well, no... nothing. (Shit, I almost let it slip. Wait, don't panic, calm down. I need to play it cool. I need to show her how cool I am.)”
...Let's just ignore them.
“Let's go, Tsubaki.”
“Oh, I hope Eiichi succeeds in his romance.”
In a city full of young people, the streets during the evenings are always full of life.
This is Central Boulevard, the heart of Tomanbetsu City's Central District.
Fast-food restaurants, coffee houses, karaoke bars, and so on; all sorts of entertainment hotspots exist for young people who don't go home right after school.
“Wow, it's so crowded. I'm getting lost.”
“Are you some country bumpkin?”
“I've never been to Central Boulevard. It's kinda scary, and I feel like a bad girl for not going home directly after school.”
“You know, you're just like one of those perfectly innocent girls out of a manga.”
Indeed. If we keep walking, we'll come across a lot of clubs and studios. Then we'll wander right into the red light district.
“Do you come here often?”
“Me?”
...How should I respond?
I often skip classes, and my grades and physical evaluations are mediocre. My image at school is that of someone who plays cool but is a frivolous womanizer.
“...I go shopping around here every once in a while.”
“By yourself?”
“Why do you ask?”
“Oh, no reason. It's just that you seem to have a lot of friends outside of school.”
“Sometimes I'm alone. Sometimes I'm with another person.”
...
“Are you in a club?”
...It seems that this girl...
“By clubs, do you mean a dance club or a boxing club?”
...Wants to know more about me recently.
“Sorry if it sounds like I'm doing a background check. It's just, you know... even though we're always in the same class, I don't know anything about you.”
...If we're always in the same class, then why would you wait until now to approach me?
“Haha... to be honest, I'm usually with a woman.”
...Let's try to get her to despise me a little.
“There's no way to sugarcoat this, really, but uh... I'm a pretty lecherous playboy.”
I need to maintain just the right distance from my classmates. Not too close, and not too far.
“Sorry. You must hate womanizers like me, right?”
Yet she smiled.
“How silly! Of course not!”
“......”
“It's a little scary, sure, but I probably only think that because I don't know enough about people like that.”
I studied Tsubaki's expression.
“‘It's not nice to judge people you don't know,’ right?”
There isn't even a tiny bit of insincerity in her smile.
“Therefore, until I fully understand you, I can't possibly hate you.”
“...I see.”
I don't think it would be overgenerous to consider Tsubaki a gentle and pure human being.
“Well, let's not just stand here and chat. Where should we go?”
“I'll just follow your lead.”
“How about a coffee shop?”
“Sure. I'm a little nervous, though.”
“Is this your first time going to a coffee shop?”
“Is there anything I need to bring? Like something to take notes?”
“You're fine as-is. Just follow me.”
The coffee shop ‘Lapis Lazuli’ is a quaint little spot here on Central Boulevard.
It's calm, and the clientèle is generally a pretty nice crowd.
For someone like Tsubaki, this is a perfect place.
“Whoa, nine hundred yen for a single cup of coffee!?”
She really is one of the common folk...
“Where do you normally go to have fun?”
“Mmm, the swings in the park?”
“Huh? What are you, a child?”
“Is that weird?”
“Well, not exactly...”
“I also make sandcastles.”
...Is this girl actually lonely...?
“What I meant was, do you go shopping or sing at karaoke bars? You know, things that people your age normally like to do?”
“I go shopping sometimes. You have no idea how often I need to buy more diaries.”
“That's because you write down everything.”
“Do you have any hobbies, Azai-kun?”
“Me?”
...How should I answer this?
“I like to play around with women.”
“Huh? What do you play?”
“Just kidding. To be honest, I'm glad you didn't get that one.”
“You mean, like playing hide-and-seek?”
...Why are children's games the only things she can come up with...?
“If you really want an answer, it's music.”
The truth leaks out of my mouth before I can stop it.
“Music, huh? Oh, I love visual kei.”
“You're into heavy music, then? I personally prefer classical.”
an interesting little tidbit.”
“There you go taking notes again.”
“Keep going, keep going. Who's your favorite composer?”
“...Probably J.S. Bach.”
“Eh? Sorry, could you repeat that?”
“I just told you, Bach.”
“Oh, Bach. Sorry, the initials kind of threw me off.”
“There are many ‘Bachs’ in history, because it's a family name. But the most famous Bach, the one I referred to, is Johann Sebastian Bach. Some people call him the ‘Big Bach’.”
“......”
Tsubaki suddenly stopped writing.
“Huh? Why did you close your diary?”
“Well, I've just never seen you with such a big smile on your face before...”
“A big smile?”
“Sorry. That must've sounded strange.”
Is she trying to say I'm showing off or something...?
“But you know, I saw a totally different side of you today. I'm very happy.”
...No. She's definitely not that type of person.
“Next time we meet, do you think I could borrow some CDs from you?”
“Sure... oh, a new Bach CD is coming out tomorrow. Of course, when I say ‘new’, it means a new compilation of his works.”
“You're looking forward to it?”
“Well, to be honest, I really am. I've been literally counting off the days to release on my fingers.”
“Well, can we go together to buy it tomorrow?”
“...Can I take your planning for tomorrow to be a sign that you're ready to head home?”
“Oh, yes. Sorry. The sun's setting a lot sooner nowadays, you know? But we'll be able to play tomorrow too, so it's no big deal.”
...We haven't even started the whole ‘playing’ part yet. Oh well.
“Let's go, then. I'll pay the tab.”
“My tea was 950 yen.”
She gave me a thousand yen bill.
“Hold on. Let me see if I have a fifty yen coin...”
“Dangit. I don't have change.”
“Oh, don't worry about it.”
“No, I'll go get some change.”
“Please, like I said, don't worry about it. After all, I'm the one who asked you to come.”
She insisted on giving me the money.
“No, I can't do that.”
“You're too uptight... it's just fifty yen.”
I stared at Tsubaki.
“I already told you, I can't do that.”
“Huh?”
“Even if it's just fifty yen, money is still money.”
Tsubaki stopped smiling.
“...Understand?”
Tsubaki once said,
"It's not nice to judge people you don't know."
But I know, without a shadow of a doubt...
...that anyone who doesn't value money is, in most cases, evil.
......
...
I walked Tsubaki all the way to the subway station.
“Be careful on your way home.”
“Okay. See you tomorrow.”
“Tomorrow?”
“Stop joking around. We agreed to go buy that CD together, remember?”
I don't know how to respond.
“...So we did.”
“Also, I need to buy a new diary. I would be happy if you went with me.”
“There may be an emergency, but if that's all you want, I think I'll have time.”
“Emergency?”
“Yeah, um... that must have sounded kinda strange.”
“You mean you might get a call at any time?”
“A call?”
“Your phone's always ringing, Azai-kun. At least it seems that way.”
...She really does seem to be interested in me.
“Well... like I said, I should have the time.”
“Really?”
Tsubaki smiled and waved at me.
“Alright, then! Bye-bye!”
“Yeah...”
Tsubaki walked down into the subway station.
“Now...”
There are so many things I still need to take care of today.
Just as I was about to leave, I felt something tug at my memory.
It's six right now.
...Didn't I have an appointment at six?
Something about Kanon...
...I think so, actually. The skating rink, or something...
“......”
Oh well... if I can't remember it, then it probably wasn't too important.
...I don't think I made any appointments.
Time to head back.
“Azai-kun!”
“Huh?”
“Great! You haven't left yet.”
“What happened? Why'd you run back like that?”
Trying to catch her breath, Tsubaki said,
“...Um, could you give me your phone number?”
I chuckled.
“Oh. Is that it?”
I told her my number.
“Thank you.”
“What's yours?”
“I don't have a cell phone.”
“Eh? In this day and age?”
“I guess it doesn't really seem necessary.”
“But that's pretty inconvenient, isn't it? Let's buy one while we're out tomorrow.”
“That's alright. The home phone is good enough.”
Girls like her are rare these days.
“I'll call you later. Be sure to answer the phone.”
“Okay...”
This time, Tsubaki really left.
“But still...”
Why did she suddenly become interested in me?
Hmm. I don't think I should get too close to her.
Treading upon the stones of Central Boulevard, I begin my walk home.
People often say I'm absentminded.
But when it comes to money, I'll never miss a beat.
The ones who do could never dream of reaching my level.
When I arrived home, I immediately walked into the study and picked up the phone.
“Sorry to bother you. Are you by any chance the president of Kotani Incorporated?”
On the other end of the line, the voice of a middle aged man full of anger replied.
“This is Kotani. Who the hell are you!?”
He must think I'm weak just because I sound young.
“My name is Azai Kyousuke. Nice to meet you.”
“Azai Kyousuke...”
His voice faded.
“Oh, right. Azai Gonzou's right-hand man.”
Right-hand man...
People used to say that I was just a little small fry that leeched off of his father's position. Looks like people's opinions of me have risen recently.
“Since the brain of the Azai Corporation is talking, I'll be blunt. You're trespassing on our turf. How do you plan on ‘compensating’ for this?”
The Azai Corporation is a yakuza group with diffuse connections throughout both the underworld and the police force.
It's also a major member of the Souwa Alliance.
My father, Azai Gonzou, is one of the leaders of the pack.
Due to police crackdowns, the days when yakuza used force to fight over territory have passed.
On the verge of collapse, the yakuza bosses gathered together and proposed a peaceful coexistence doctrine. They then began to use legitimate businesses as fronts.
The one that acted as a spearhead for this conversion from underground society to the normal world was the Azai Corporation.
“Compensating...? Well, you certainly don't sound too calm about this.”
On the surface, the Azai Corporation is legal, but it really is just a Souwa branch company.
Basically, the Azai Corporation is the front for Souwa. It manages the group's financial affairs, like real estate, construction, tourism, dining, theme parks, golf courses, and much more.
Our revenue compares favorably with even the biggest legitimate corporations.
“The clubs and hotels in the Central District are supposed to be under our jurisdiction.”
Unfortunately, we have some disputes with other organizations within the circle. For example, the person yelling at me right now.
Of course, these types of conflicts are common in business, and they should be common sense by now. Yet these yakuza are still stuck in their old ways of settling things with informal dealings like this.
“I'm terribly sorry, but there wasn't anything that suggested only you could open clubs and hotels there.”
“This is bullshit! That's been my turf for ten years! How could you not know about this!?”
...He's right. I knew about it.
I also know that those hotels and clubs make up most of his revenue.
“Nothing in this world remains constant, even long-term collaborations. Otherwise, you'd never see divorces, right?”
“What did you say?”
His breathing became wild.
“Kotani-san. You seem to have misunderstood something. This isn't about us trying to take over your turf. We're merely expanding our market.”
“It's just that our company worked a little harder than yours. This is a legitimate business. Within that context, is there really any need to ask a competitor's opinion on how we should conduct ourselves?”
At that moment, I heard something break on the other end of the line.
He probably kicked over his desk out of anger, insulted that he was being criticized by a mere boy.
“Listen, you little shit. We're a front for the Souwa Alliance too, you know. In other words, we're like brothers to the Azai Corporation.”
“And?”
“Stop fucking with me. Are you trying to take money from a brother? You're the son of someone in the business, and you don't even know your manners!?”
“Technically, I'm not a part of the ‘family’.”
And anyway, Azai Gonzou never taught me such courtesies.
Azai Gonzou told me this, instead: when talking to idiots like this man, one must have the mind of a hunter before his prey.
“Oh, sorry to change the subject, but I believe your company has a lot of cash at hand, right?”
“Aah!?”
“They came from illegitimate business deals, didn't they?”
“Watch your mouth, boy. What proof do you have?”
“I checked up on your company's recent actions. I found contracts from backdoor dealings in order to conceal your income and numerous bank accounts using fictitious names. Don't you think the police would be interested in these documents?”
“I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about!”
I didn't let up on my prey.
“I'll just go ahead and make these public, then.”
I can imagine the expression on his face.
“Y-, you trying to blackmail me?”
“Of course not. I've always preferred legal methods when it comes to settling disputes. As long as you can accept our recently-opened clubs and hotels in the Central District, I'll be quite satisfied.”
A murderous cry poured from the receiver. It was filled with humiliation.
And with that, he finally surrendered.
After all, I held the ace.
All that's left is to put just a tiny bit more pressure on him.
“Well then, it's been nice talking to you.”
When I put down the phone, I checked my email, and picked up the phone once more.
“Hey, it's Kyousuke. Thanks for taking my call.”
...This has been my life ever since I met Azai Gonzou.
“I'm calling to speak to you about the bill from the Showa Management Company...”
...An enormous sum of cash circulates under my direction, yet I'm not even a formal employee of the Azai Corporation.
“Yes. I read your proposal, but that's not enough...”
...I'm just a student, but my decisions can cause companies to go bankrupt, or even condemn people to ruin.
“Yes... generally speaking, a company needs to prepare three copies...”
The only thing I learned up until now... is that money is everything.
“One copy for the shareholder, one copy for the bank, and one for the business you're dealing with. Of course, each copy needs to be slightly different. I'm sure you know this, right?”
Everyone lives for money. Their lives revolve around money.
“That's correct... no, no... that company won't last much longer if you ask me... sure...”
Age, sex, occupation... none of these matter when compared alongside one's accumulated wealth.
“Not at all. If you're happy with my advice, I can give you as much as you want... right...”
...Everyone fears and respects me.
――But I won't stop here.
I want more power.
At the moment it's just the Azai Corporation, but someday, I'll take over all of Souwa.
Then I'll have the power to affect society as a whole.
Politicians, CEOs of multinational corporations, they'll all bow before me.
What I want is the position of the puppet master in the shadows.
It's just like...
‘So you're going to be a hero, huh? Then I'll...’
“......”
Like... what?
A sharp pain is throbbing in my forehead.
‘What's going on?’ the person on the other end of the line asked.
“Hm? Oh, it's nothing. I look forward to doing more business with you in the future.”
I quickly hang up the phone.
I never bother to remember anything from my daily life that doesn't have anything to do with money――school, for example.
I rested for a while in the living room.
Suddenly, I was watching my hands reach out for a coat.
My memory of that day... ended there.
......
...
...Alright.
I won't hesitate any longer.
“Talk to me, Kanon.”
Gazing at her, I leave these few, short words.
“Err... umm...”
“Yes?”
“I just... I just want you to protect me, Nii-san.”
“Protect you?”
“Well, I mean... I mean I wanna be your p-... partner.”
“Partner...?”
I suppose we're not talking about figure skating here.
“Do you hate me, Nii-san?”
“Can't say I do...”
“So that's an ‘okay’... right?”
I shake my head.
“You know, Kanon...”
She interrupted me, possibly fearing an outright refusal.
“Y-yeah, I know, you're not interested in things like that. I know that.”
have an interest in things like that.”
“I know right? I was surprised too.”
I sighed deeply as my sight fell down to the floor.
In her heart, Kanon must be incredibly anxious, despite her leisurely attitude. Each one of my words must feel heavy to her.
“Well, I can't really take the moral high ground anymore by saying we're just brother and sister...”
“Yeah, you're too much of a bad boy to say stuff like that anyway.”
“But, you know, I can't just up and see you in that light.”
“We'll just have to change that, then.”
Such optimism only showcases her anxiety.
“On the contrary, let me ask you a question: why do you like me?”
“Good question!”
“Answer me seriously.”
Focusing on skating for so long has stunted her ability to do other things, like uphold sincere, heart-to-heart conversations.
“Because... because... you're on my side...”
“I'm on your side?”
“And because you're reliable. Because you're kind, and gentle...”
“There are more reliable people out there than you could ever want, Kanon. Take Ikuko-san, f-”
Kanon interrupted me a second time.
“No, it's only you, Nii-san, not anybody else. Coach is... well... Coach's just Coach.”
“Are you sure you aren't just lonely?”
“I am lonely...”
Her words fell like droplets.
“But still... I love you, Nii-san.”
She turned away from me, muttering.
“...Huh?”
I was hung up on something.
I remembered something as I stared at her childish profile.
“Hey, back when you were a kid...”
“Hm?”
“...Nah, it's nothing. I was just thinking about how long we've known each other.”
“It's been a real long time, huh?”
“When did we first meet?”
“Oh, uh... it was that time you almost starved to death.”
“Starved to death...?”
“Yeah, remember? You lived in a janky old apartment then, instead of this fancy place.”
“Right... that sure was a long time ago. The bath and toilet were in the same room, the walls were paper thin... there was barely enough room to move around in. It was pretty much the definition of janky.”
Gonzou bought it for me, as a place to stay until I found a way to make a living.
The joker told me he'd buy me anything I needed, but I was way too scared to ask for anything big.
As I look back, I can laugh at the situation. I mean, it's pretty funny if you think about it.
than vice versa. Oh, that place was god awful.”
“Wasn't the complex called ‘Piti Falls’?”
“No, you gave it that name.”
I couldn't help but laugh.
;Gonzou gave me that room before I found a way to make a living.
“Old times...”
“Tell me about it.”
“You were so mean back in those days.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, do you remember the time I brought you some food?”
“No, what happened?”
“‘How much?’ You gave me a glare that I thought would kill me.”
“‘There is no such thing as a free lunch,’ you know.”
“And then you wouldn't take the dang food until you forced two hundred yen down my throat. I told you your money was no good, but you didn't listen...”
I had heard that you were Gonzou's daughter.
I figured it'd be bad to owe you of all people a favor.
As we found ourselves drifting into tales of the past, the tension in the room around us began to melt.
“You were already skating by that time, right?”
“Yup, and I always won.”
“Yes, you did. TV news teams came to my home to talk to me. You have no idea how much that annoyed me. People called me the brother of the ‘genius skating girl’. I just wanted to crawl under some rock and die.”
It may have been a command of Gonzou's that kept Kanon's complicated family situation largely unknown to the outside world.
“Nii-san, you're so gloomy... I don't think they'll ever find a cure.”
“Shut up...”
I smiled bitterly.
“Mmm, you're the best, Nii-san.”
“What...?”
“Sometimes it seems like you're the only one on Non-chan's side.”
She wore a blissful, radiant smile.
“You come off like a person with a whole lot of friends, but the truth is, you only have a couple...”
“Of all the...?”
“But even out of those... only Non-chan loves you like this.”
Kanon's gentle voice flows into my ears.
Her breath tickles and massages me, and my strengthless knees cause my feet to stagger.
“Mm...”
“What's up?”
“...Mm... well... is it cold in here to you?”
“Not at all.”
“C'mon, it's freezing in here. Wait... I'm feeling dizzy, and my heart's racing.”
“That's love!”
“It's the flu, you idiot.”
“You sure? Are you okay?”
She put her palm to my forehead nervously.
“Uwawa... you gotta be hotter than a hundred and four!”
Please don't scare me like that...
“It's because you're always pushing yourself too much... you can be so stupid sometimes!”
Well, it is true that I didn't notice it until I relaxed.
“Hey, Kanon...”
“I'll bring you some porridge...! Do you like plum? I'll mix some in.”
“No, wait...”
...I'm so damn cold...
“...C-can you sleep by yourself? I gave you the key to the room, right?”
“Yeah, what about it?”
“I'm going out. Bye...”
“W-waitwaitwait!”
She almost fell over when she grabbed my arm. She looked like a comedian.
“W-why!?”
“If you catch my sickness, all of Japan will hate me.”
“Where are you going?”
“A hotel, or something.”
No, hotels are too expensive.
Eiichi's Palace is a possibility for the night, I suppose.
Maybe I can give that little prick the flu... he's an idiot, though, so he probably won't catch it...
...Ngh!
My vision suddenly went black, and I was coated in the sensation that my body was floating in air.
I open my eyes.
Kanon is gazing at me with an air of uneasiness.
“Wah... what should I do...? What should I do...?”
The sound of Kanon stomping about on the floor fills my ears.
Heavy steps echo in my skull.
“There's no choice! Non-chan will keep you warm, Nii-san!”
My mind was swallowed by darkness after hearing these words.
......
...
I strengthen my resolve and dial the number.
“...Azai-san...”
Usami seemed to have something to say, but decided to give up and hold her tongue.
...
......
Two agonizingly long rings met my ear before someone picked up.
‘Is your emergency a crime or an accident...?’
I think I somehow managed to describe the incident smoothly.
The police mobilized quickly once alerted to the situation.
Dozens of patrol cars promptly surrounded the school.
The police took over the situation, and we were no longer needed.
They made the school's athletics grounds their base, set up a whole array of communications devices, and began negotiations immediately.
Hashimoto had apparently been bluffing about killing the hostages, as he surrendered with very little resistance.
The apparent commander of the police team was able to persuade him to stand down after no more than two or three phone calls.
Thus, Miss Noriko and Shiratori were released, and the affair came to a close.
In the end, I had made the right choice.
Shiratori's white skin had transformed into a downright death-pallor by the time she was ushered into a patrol car for an interview downtown.
She looked to be still unable to fathom the tragedy which had just befallen her.
She was trembling, like a small, terrified animal.
I feel like I should have said something to her.
...
......
“In the end, Kyousuke-kun made the right choice, Mizuha.”
“...Yeah.”
“Daddy's negotiation was something to behold. I've still got a lot to learn if I'm going to live up to his name.”
“He had the culprit entirely at a loss.”
“Were you treated well, Mizuha?”
“Yeah... I was fine.”
Wait.
“...Hey, can I go home yet?”
“No, you may not.”
“Is there a particular reason I have to be present for your little denouement?”
“Please...? I'll treat you to lunch.”
“No. Look, the case is absolutely closed. There's nothing else to say about it, is there?”
According to the news, Hashimoto's demand was to have his father released. However, the investigation is still ongoing.
Thanks to the police's speedy resolution of the conflict, Shiratori walked away unharmed.
Nevertheless, she did take a two day break from school. Hence the midday off-campus gathering.
As for me, I was tricked into this little lunch meeting by Tokita.
“Now, Mizuha, say ‘Thank you’ to Kyousuke-kun.”
“...Huh? Why?”
“He saved you, didn't he?”
“The police saved me.”
She has a point. All I did was call them.
“There's no need for thanks. It'd probably just gross me out anyway.”
For some reason, Shiratori sulked at that.
“...Excuse me? Gross you out?”
“Come now, Mizuha, the man's just a little twisted, is all.”
“Just like you, Shiratori.”
“Though to a far greater degree.”
“Yeah, sure. Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
“...Hmph.”
...Who put the stick up her ass? Could she possibly be any more childish...?
“Look, do you two have any business with me or not?”
“Of course! We wanted to thank you for helping us out.”
‘Isn't that so?’ she adds to Mizuha, who ignores her as furiously as she does me.
“...Alright. I accept your appreciation. I'm out of here.”
“Ah, one second.”
“......”
“Don't give me that glare. I want to buy you a CD.”
“A CD?”
“You know, that... Wagner...”
“Oh? Have you finally reflected on your inappropriate behavior...? Well, I suppose it couldn't hurt. You did shatter my last copy, after all.”
“...I don't even care anymore.”
Shiratori stood from her seat.
“Well then, shall we go shopping?”
“Sure...”
“Hehe...”
...What's so funny?
It may have been a weekday afternoon, but Central Boulevard was crowded nonetheless.
“Wait, hold on a second. I have a stamp card from the CD shop I usually go to. Buy me something if you want, but you gotta use this.”
“What a cheapskate.”
“Yup, I'm one miserly bastard.”
“...Don't act so proud about that.”
...There's something odd about all this.
Shiratori looks at me as if I were a particularly offensive insect.
Meanwhile, she says she wants to buy me a CD.
Would she really do something so obviously disturbing to her sensibilities just because I dialed ‘911’?
“...Is there something else to this?”
“Yet again, you're quick to doubt people.”
“Out with it. You two are acting about as suspicious as they come.”
“You can't even trust people's goodwill.”
“Fine, I give up. Just hurry up and buy what you came to buy.”
“...I'm starting to regret I ever offered.”
“Good for you.”
“N-now, Mizuha...!”
Tokita suddenly panicked.
“What, Nee-san?”
“You're... you're going about this all wrong...!”
...Hm?
“...Explain.”
“Just come here a second.”
Tokita yanks Shiratori by the arm.
“Ah, hey...!”
They run off toward a corner of the street, leaving me behind.
“Heeeyyy!”
They ignored me.
I try to listen in.
“...But...”
Shiratori seemed to be pouting like a child.
“...Remember what I told you...? You can't get angry over every little thing...”
“Right...”
“Good, now smile! Smile...!”
“A-alright... like this?”
“Very good... excellent! Excellent!”
“A-are you sure?”
“Most definitely. You look like a proper heartbreaker now. Go get him, Mizuha!”
...What in God's name are they talking about?
After a short moment, the two of them come back.
“S-sorry to keep you waiting...”
A stiff smile was plastered on her face.
“W-what are you doing to this poor girl, Tokita?”
“Beg your pardon?”
Tokita's lips curved into a cheesy smile.
“I-I can see what's going on here. You two are planning something, aren't you!?”
“Not at all. Isn't that right, Mizuha?”
Mizuha nodded like a robot.
“...M-may I walk beside you?”
“S-sure, why not...?”
“Well said, both of you!”
“W-what!?”
This just crossed the line from absurdity to terror...
“I KNEW you were up to something!”
“We're not up to anything. And doubting one's warmth is the quickest way to end a friendship.”
“Yeah. It's an awful feeling to lose your trust in someone.”
“Well, you're not exactly acting very trustworthy here...”
It's like they're begging for me to be suspicious of them.
“You really don't have any ulterior motives?”
“Of course not!”
Tokita looks shady even when she's telling the truth.
I should ask Shiratori instead.
“Well?”
“How many times are you going to ask?”
“This is it. I won't ask again, I swear. Just look me in the eyes when you answer.”
“Huh? L-look you in the eyes?”
She plainly hesitated before I even asked.
“Are you intending to convey your feelings, Kyousuke? Am I in the way?”
“Where the hell do you pull these ideas out of?”
“Convey your...!? You... you mean you love me!?”
“Uh... no.”
“Are you trying to play with my expectations!?”
“I'm not trying to play with anything.”
They're up to something, no matter how I look at it.
As long as they're not trying to pull one over on me, it's no big deal.
However, I can't help but feel that I'm somehow the target of this little charade.
“We're getting nowhere here.”
“That's my line.”
“Look here, Mizuha. Aren't these clothes cute? Dreadfully cute, if you ask me.”
“Oh, yeah. They're adorable.”
“You're into fashions like these, Shiratori?”
They didn't really seem to fit her persona, so I'm a bit taken aback.
They were clothes more suited to a sultry, adult woman.
“The clothes you wear tend to trim down your ‘assets’, Mizuha. You'd probably get more bang for your buck if you flaunted them a little.”
“Bang? What do you mean, ‘bang’, Tokita?”
“Her ability to attract the boy she likes, of course.”
“Nee-san!”
“You're so cute when you're angry.”
“Nee-san!”
“Come now, don't be like that.”
Shiratori is once again yanked to a safe distance.
“If you keep this up... you'll...”
“Right, right...”
“You gotta give a little of this, a little of that...”
“...Oh, I gotcha.”
“Seriously, if you're not going to buy me that CD, I've got no reason to be here.”
“Don't worry.”
Shiratori smiles at me... in the most forced, cheesy manner imaginable.
“Are you girls brainstorming about ways to annoy me when you run off together?”
“I was just trying to get her to smile to relax the atmosphere.”
Didn't work so well.
“Cut it out, already.”
“I'm not doing anything.”
“It sure looks like you are.”
“What do you want me to do?”
“Shut up and buy me the CD. Then keep quiet until we say goodbye.”
“That's no fun.”
“Is this supposed to be fun?”
“Shopping should always be fun, shouldn't it? Am I wrong?”
“Fine, I get it. You can talk, just start walking.”
They've been standing still for too long now.
“Well, now that we've resolved that little conflict, shall we?”
She was the one who started ‘that little conflict’...
“Let's go.”
“Thank you...”
And this one keeps throwing me strange looks.
...We passed the minutes of our trek to the CD store clamorously.
The sun was now setting, yet I was still being dragged around by these two.
“So, Kyousuke-kun... do you have any questions for Mizuha?”
“Not in particular...”
She's been like this the whole time.
“I thought you said you were interested in her? No, I'm sure of it, you mentioned that the other day.”
That was just a little recon for my revenge.
Shiratori's scornful eyes threatened to bore holes in me as she walked alongside me.
“Uh... you like stars, right?”
“...So?”
“Nothing, I just figured it was a pity we missed out last time.”
”
“W-what!?”
I swear Tokita just reached out for Shiratori's butt from her position behind us.
“It's nothing. Right, Mizuha?”
“...Y-yeah... right, it was a pity. So...”
“So...?”
“...S-so... uh... w-want to...?”
“Want to...?”
Tokita immediately spoke up after I finished.
“She's asking if you want to go see the stars again.”
“Oh, so that's what the stuttering was about.”
“...How about it?”
“Nah, can't be bothered.”
“...N-Nee-san...!”
Shiratori looked up at her sister in a panic, clearly at a loss for what to do.
“Listen now, Kyousuke-kun. Isn't that a bit cruel?”
“Not in the least. I have business to tend to. I don't have time to be playing around with you two.”
“Nuh-uh.”
Her eyes were cold.
I tilted my head.
“...What do you want, anyway?”
I'm sure it's money they're after.
“I'm a born miser. You won't be able to squeeze anything out of this rock.”
“Are you talking about money?”
“Money, stuff, time, anything.”
“What about love?”
“Love?”
“Yes, love.”
“...That's disgusting...”
I don't recall ever being in love.
“Then what about a scream? Will I get a scream out of you if I squeeze you hard enough?”
“Most likely, yeah.”
“Alright, then...”
“‘Alright, then...’ my ass. I'm not going to sit by and let you hit me.”
Freaking psycho.
“...Look, I'm out of here.”
“Wait a minute.”
“What is it this time? Give me a break. If you've got business with me, leave it for tomorrow.”
“Tell me...!”
“Huh?”
“Tell me your...!”
She started out clear enough, but...
“...Cell phone number...”
...she mumbled the rest of her sentence.
“Why?”
“......”
Why is she going all silent?
“...I-if something like what happened the other day happens again, I might need it.”
...Meaning the hostage case?
“You're not going to prank call me at midnight asking for money, are you?”
“Of course not!”
“Well, alright...”
Unlike Usami, Shiratori doesn't seem to be the type to call without good reason.
“...Phew...”
With an exhausted expression, she hands her phone to me.
“That's quite the cutesy phone you have considering your perpetually grave expression.”
There were bear and squirrel phone straps on it.
We finished exchanging numbers, and I waved goodbye.
“Later...”
“Yeah, see you tomorrow at school...”
Tokita had a strange grin on her face.
“...Bye.”
Shiratori grew sullen once more.
I don't know what this is about, but I'm positive now that they're trying to trick me somehow.
I'd better watch my back.
I return home and pass the time doing work for Gonzou.
I hang up after finishing a call with the Azai Corporation, then casually look at my cell phone.
I had apparently missed quite a few calls.
...Come to think of it, I remember having to ignore a few calls during that last conversation.
They were all from Shiratori.
If I had known she would call me so soon, I wouldn't have given her the number...
In any case, I'd better call her back.
She answered before it even had the chance to ring twice.
“Uh, hello?”
No response.
She refused to make any sound besides faint, rhythmic breathing.
“Look, why'd you call me?”
“......”
“Hey!”
“Oh, uh... are you okay for time right now?”
“I wouldn't have called you back if I wasn't.”
“I guess.”
She coughed.
“I want to talk to you about something tomorrow. Do you have the time?”
Is it just me, or does she sound like she's reading from a script?
”
...That's what I want to ask.
Shrill laughs echoed from the other end of the line.
“...Uh... after school?”
“Yeah, I guess...”
“As long as we can make it quick, it shouldn't be a problem...”
...No, this has to be a trap.
“Look, just tell me now. What are you calling about?”
“......”
“Hey, don't go all silent on me.”
“Just wait a second!”
“A-alright...”
There was a rustling sound.
After a moment, she spoke again without intonation.
“I want to speak to you in person.”
“...Oh?”
...Is she going to ask me to lend her money?
“Well?”
“I'll give you ten, no, fifteen minutes... but if it's about money, I'll tell you right now, you'd better ask someone else.”
“It's not about money. Why are you always like that?”
Shiratori finally returned to her typical ill temper.
That made me feel a little more at ease.
“Always?”
I laughed.
“What do you think you know about me? And what do you mean, ‘always’? You think you can just see right through me, or something?”
“I do. I've always been watching you...!”
“Huh!?”
The call suddenly cut off.
...Did her signal drop?
She doesn't call back.
It's somewhat upsetting to just leave it at that, but I feel like I'd lose at something if I gave in and called her back.
Still, what was she saying at the end there...?
...Well, whatever.
Tomorrow, huh?
I tumble into bed and close my eyes.
Despite having just experienced an affair as monstrous as a hostage crisis, my days have once again become utterly peaceful.
For some reason, Shiratori's face lingers in my mind.
She's been a little strange ever since Tokita came into town.
They really do act like sisters... though I suppose they have different mothers, or something...
In any case, they get on well together.
Fleeting memories of my family painted my consciousness as my mind drifted in the darkness.
However, like a shooting star, those old memories soon left me in the hands of the warm abyss of sleep.
...Yeah.
I shouldn't have any more hesitation.
I don't know when it first began, but as I stand here, I find myself attracted to Tsubaki.
“Tsubaki...”
Her face, puffy from crying, slowly turned my way.
“A-Azai-kun...”
I held out her diary and averted my eyes.
“You forgot this.”
“Thanks for going to the trouble of bringing it here.”
Tsubaki sniffled, then smiled.
It was a pure smile.
“Um, bye...”
“Azai-kun, wait a minute.”
She stopped me.
If I let her stop me here, I will become irrevocably drawn to her.
“Do you want to eat at my house?”
“No thanks...”
“Your boyfriend should definitely come, Sis!”
“......”
Hiroaki's expression was exactly the same as his sister's.
“I'm a bit busy. Do you have time later tonight?”
“Tonight...?”
“There are some things I want to talk to you about.”
“To talk about?”
“It's about our relationship.”
“Uh-um, I don't quite understand, but tonight I... you know, with my family...”
“Don't worry about me——. I'll wait at home——.”
“It's decided, then.”
“Ah, sure...”
“I'll call you later.”
The moment I turned, I slipped fantastically onto the snow-slick ground.
“...Whuaaa!?”
“...Ah!”
A bright, cheerful sound immediately filled the surrounding air.
“Ahahaha, ahahaha, Onii-chan, that was so lame!”
Tsubaki's eyes widened.
“What...?”
“N-nothing. It's just that you're always so calm and cool so I was a bit taken aback...”
“Tch...”
Looks like I'm out of it tonight.
“Onii-chan, Onii-chan, can we play hide-and-seek next time? I'm really good at hiding.”
“Uhm? Oh, sure. Next time.”
“Really!? Awesome!”
I only said that casually, but he took it for a promise.
“That's great, Hiroaki. Azai-kun actually agreed to play with you, that's amazing!”
As did his sister, I guess.
...Don't tell me I really have to go through with this boring little game now.
“Thank you for coming all this way. I'll catch you later.”
“Yeah...”
“See you tonight! I'll be waiting beside the phone!”
“Yeah...”
“Hmm? What's the matter?”
“Oh... it's nothing...”
I suddenly realized that I just couldn't keep my eyes off her face.
“I'm heading home.”
I quietly bid her farewell, for real this time.
“Bye!”
That bright, clear voice still lingered in my ear.
...I find myself flustered.
I want to just lie down and clutch my head.
For crying out loud, the girl doesn't even have a penny to her name...
I tried to work, but my foggy mind could not escape its many torturous, invasive thoughts of Tsubaki.
......
...
...
......
“Come in...”
“Thanks for coming to pick me up...”
Nine P.M.
The swirling snow soon stopped.
After a brief consultation session with a local firm, I went to Tsubaki's house and brought her over.
“Would you like some coffee?”
“No, I'm fine...”
“Really...?”
I looked away idly.
“......”
“......”
“The snow really came down today, huh.”
“Yeah, the trains were canceled everywhere.”
“Yeah, I saw...”
“Yup.”
The silence continued.
“Azai-kun, I, uh... I have a request.”
“A request?”
“Um, I'm sorry to do this to you so suddenly...”
Her eyes shifted to the paperwork she had been going through earlier.
I already understood.
“Don't worry about it.”
“Hm?”
“This is about the work I gave you, right? You don't need to help out if you don't want to.”
That kind of job doesn't really suit her anyway.
“Ah, wait, it's not like that...”
Tsubaki quickly shook her head.
“I just want to spend more time with my family from now on, so I might be able to help occasionally.”
“Don't push yourself. Your family's huge, after all. Between cooking, bathing, and playing, I'm honestly surprised you've even been able to manage school up to now.”
“That's a bit of an exaggeration.”
“Really? Regardless, you should put your family first.”
“Right... but the thing is, Azai-kun, you're no less important to me than them.”
She put it so simply.
I distinctly felt my breath stop cold.
let me, right? There's still so much I want to learn about you.”
“You might not like me saying this, Azai-kun, but... your childhood... it just... it was lonely, wasn't it?”
“Why would I mind you saying that? It's the truth. Still, I didn't feel like I was particularly lonely.”
“The fact that you would even think something like that... even that seems lonely to me...”
“Tsubaki...”
“I know you carry burdens I wouldn't be able to understand, but I want to help you.”
Tsubaki seemed a little agitated.
“So go on, say something. I'll do anything you need done.”
“Alright, go hop in the shower.”
“Eh——!?”
“W-wait, no, I'm kidding. It was a bad joke.”
Tsubaki's face was boiling red.
“H-hey, calm down. I told you, it was just one of my usual crappy jokes. Seriously...”
“...A-alright. You had me scared there for a second...”
Damn... I thought she'd find that funny.
“Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about something...”
Tsubaki nodded obediently.
“I may just be flattering myself here, but...”
“......”
“You like me, right?”
Tsubaki's suddenly stiffened up.
She lowered her head and trembled uncontrollably. Then, with a red face, she nodded slightly.
“Uh, um...”
“Yeah, since a long time ago... um, I always wanted an excuse to talk to you, and when we went to buy that CD after school the other day, I felt, really, very happy...”
“We, uh... we've been together a lot recently, so I've been thinking about when I should tell you. Ah, I mean, you know... to, uh... to confess...”
“So... yeah, you're right.”
Tsubaki glanced up at me adorably.
“I like you, Azai-kun.”
The momentary silence befell us once again.
I should be saying something right now.
“Let's go to school together tomorrow morning.”
“Pardon?”
“That was kind of my way of saying... stay the night with me, Tsubaki.”
mean?”
I embraced her tightly.
......
...
...
......
Ugh...
It's morning already?
I wasn't getting anything done last night because of a splitting headache, so I went straight to bed and slept until now.
Well, it was a good night's sleep.
For the first time in a while, I soaked in a nice, rejuvenating bath, washed the laundry that had piled up, and did other everyday chores I hardly ever do.
What a refreshing morning.
All those muddied thoughts have completely disappeared.
And to think Dr. Akimoto says I may have a psychological disorder. How ridiculous.
I'll go to school today.
“Morning Nii-san～.”
“Oh, Kanon. What's up? Did you come to pick me up?”
“Yup. Let's go to school together～!”
“Yeah, sure. Sounds great.”
“Okay～.”
She came a half-step closer.
“What?”
“You're in a good mood, Nii-san.”
“Maybe.”
“Why? Tell me tell me.”
“Who knows...?”
...Because it seems I'll be able to cap off all the unfinished work soon.
I've finally made some headway in the purchase of the Eastern District's properties.
...Wait.
...Huh?
Wait a minute... what ‘headway’...?
I've made no significant progress in that regard.
“What's up? Something on your mind?”
I've gotten close to Tsubaki. I've even met her family, but I've hit a wall. I don't know where to go from here.
...Then again, I've infiltrated the family at least. I guess you could call that headway...
“Hmmm... wait, why are you all gloomy all of a sudden?”
“Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm just not awake yet.”
We started walking together side by side.
“Nii-san, can we hold hands～?”
“Are you an idiot...? People would get the wrong idea.”
“What wrong idea?”
“Come on, I don't think people would respond well to the idea of a brother and a sister dating.”
“You don't need to be dating to hold hands, silly. When I was in Canada, I shook lots of people's hands.”
“But this is Japan.”
“Phooey...”
Kanon kept sticking to me like glue.
“By the way, Nii-san.”
“What? Why the long face?”
“You and Bakii have been getting real close lately, haven't you?”
“...We've just hung out a couple times.”
“It's obvious that Bakii likes you, Nii-san.”
“...Huh?”
Still, what she says is true.
“I'm not really interested in her.”
“Ah! That's so cold. I feel so sorry for Bakii.”
“It's not like she confessed to me or anything. Why should I worry about it?”
“So cold. So cold～. Bakii is a good girl, you know?”
“She is indeed a responsible person.”
“That's right, and she always stays for cleanup duty.”
“Oh, c'mon. Everyone else just forces it on her.”
“Mmm, I don't know anything about that, but she's always smiling as she does it. Wouldn't that mean that maybe it's not being forced on her?”
...Wrong, Sis. Someone like Tsubaki would smile even when forced to take care of someone else's responsibilities.
“...Oh yeah, what about that thing about being on TV?”
“Oh? Even my forgetful brother remembered that?”
“When is it? I wouldn't want to miss it if I've got some time around then...”
“The day after tomorrow.”
“Huh? Seriously? So soon...?”
“I think they invited me a long time ago. I just forgot about it.”
“Hey, don't be such an airhead. The TV station has enough trouble as it is.”
“But, but, the big-shots at the skating arena decided this without me.”
“So you don't want to do it?”
“No, I totally do. This'll make me popular!”
What an innocent girl...
I'll need to make more money, so that she can stay innocent like this.
After all, Kanon was only able to get into an expensive sport like figure skating because she had money.
“Ah...”
I brushed by Shiratori in the hallway.
“Howdy!”
Despite having never interacted much with Shiratori, Kanon waved her hand as if they were close friends.
“Morning, Shiratori.”
“...Good morning, Azai-kun.”
“......”
“......”
How can a normal greeting suddenly turn into an icy showdown?
“You're really cold, you know that?”
“Same to you.”
“Huh?”
“You ignored me yesterday, remember?”
“Yesterday?”
“...Nothing. If you can't remember then let's just drop it.”
...Why is she so angry?
“What's wrong?”
“Nothing. It's just that Shiratori hates me now.”
“Oh? Is this true, Shiratorin?”
“...Not really.”
“My brother's a good person, you know?”
Kanon only knows that I've been helping Gonzou with work.
Not even in her wildest dreams would she suspect that said work would involve kicking Tsubaki's family out of their own home.
Shiratori glared at Kanon.
“Oh, is that so? Let's just leave it at that then, shall we?”
After a while, she opened her mouth to speak.
“Also... please don't call me ‘Shiratorin’ as if we're best friends.”
She made her exit.
“Whooooa, how cold. Even I could feel the tension.”
As if the timing was deliberate, Usami suddenly emerged from the classroom.
“Now that's what I call tsun... yes, indeed...”
For some reason she nods her head.
“Did Non-chan make her mad～?”
“Don't worry about her.”
We entered the classroom.
“I know, right? It's really hard to get Funky's pudding. If you get there in the evening there's always a huge line.”
Eiichi's doing the usual, flirting with a bunch of girls.
“But I know one of the employees though～.”
“What's going on? Is Ei-chan making stuff up again?”
“(Crap! It's Kanon!)”
A typical morning scene.
“Tsubaki's not here.”
...Oh, she's right.
“It's rare to see her come in late. Wait... actually, as far as I remember I don't think it's ever happened before.”
“Even though your forgetfulness makes the trustworthiness of that statement highly suspect, I agree. This is quite disturbing.”
“Well, Tsubaki's only human. Even she's late once in a while.”
“True... but whenever I feel something's not right, I have a tendency to investigate it.”
I lower my head and start to think.
“Hey everyone～! I'm going to be on TV～!”
Kanon threw up her hands and made a commotion.
We're between classes.
I still don't see Tsubaki anywhere.
“Hey, Kyousuke, where's Tsubaki?”
“I've been wondering the same thing.”
“Look, Bro, would it kill you to tell the truth?”
“Huh?”
“It's obvious that you and Tsubaki were squeezing into the wee hours of the morning.”
“...Squeezing? What the hell does that even mean?”
“You telling me I'm wrong?”
“Of course I am. I may be a playboy, but I've never even touched her.”
“Right, sure you haven't... dammit, I want to squeeze with someone.”
...I swear to God, I have no idea how a human being could turn into a jackass like this kid...
He's so different from Tsubaki.
Then again, I probably shouldn't be talking about other people.
“Azai-san...”
Usami comes out slowly.
“I just asked the front office... apparently Tsubaki didn't call in to say she'd be absent.”
“She didn't call in?”
“Don't you find that odd?”
“Indeed.”
“You bet it's odd. And just whose fault is this, I wonder?”
“Could you call and check up on her?”
“I don't have her phone number.”
...Well, alright, that's a lie. I do have it, but Eiichi would make fun of me for it.
“Not even her cell phone number?”
“She doesn't carry a cell phone.”
“Okay kids, I've got an idea!”
“Spit it out then.”
“How about we all go directly to Tsubaki-chan's house?”
“What about class? You think we should just skip?”
It's rare for me to come to school, so I'd like to finish the day...
“Let's call her first. I'm sure the teachers have her phone number.”
“...Are you sure you're not overreacting? Maybe she just overslept.”
“I owe Tsubaki a favor.”
“A favor?”
“Yes. She helped me during the whole work permit fiasco.”
“Right...”
...I guess she has a strong sense of obligation or something.
“And for the record, Tsubaki, you're on my shit list. You're just a piddly cleric, yet I have to go through all this for you... if it turns out nothing's wrong, then so help me God, you and I are going to need to do some serious squeezing.”
“Then make the booty call. It's squeezing time.”
...What's with these punks? Do they just like saying the word ‘squeezing’...?
After getting the phone number from a teacher, I immediately call her.
“......”
“...Oh?”
Someone picked up.
Right after the first ring, no less.
“Hello, this is the Miwa family!”
I immediately notice that something's wrong.
“Hello! Hello!”
Perhaps they heard Tsubaki's voice through the phone. Both Eiichi and Usami became grave.
I quietly said,
“It's Kyousuke. What happened...?”
“Ah... Azai... kun...?”
By the time she responded, her voice seemed to have loosened up.
“Wh-what's wrong, Azai-kun?”
“I think that's my line. Why aren't you at school?”
“Ah. Sch-school...?”
“Huh?”
“Huh?”
“Huh?”
“School. That's right, we have school today...”
She let out an immense sigh.
“What's going on? You sound like you've just been abducted by aliens.”
“Etekichi-san, there are times when I'm not really sure whether or not Azai-san's analogies are actually jokes or not.”
“I know, right? If he's gonna tell bad jokes, he should at least be clear about it.”
...Hey, stop chatting behind my back like that.
“What happened?”
I didn't have to ask, ‘Did something happen?’
It's obvious that something happened.
“Wha-what?”
“Don't play dumb, Tsubaki. When someone so well-behaved with such great grades skips school without calling in, it's obvious that something happened.”
“Plus Tsubaki's the class representative. She's even the student council president, isn't she?”
“Yeah. She's really busy at times.”
“She's practically diligence incarnate. Makes me so freakin' mad...”
Tsubaki sighed again.
“...It's nothing. I just have a little cold.”
“A cold? Then why didn't you call in sick?”
“Well, sometimes... umm... I just forget about...”
“What's she saying...?”
“That's what I want to know...”
“Hey, Tsubaki... are you hiding something?”
“Hiding? No. Uh, um... *cough* *cough*”
The acting is so bad it makes me want to cry.
“If this was like, a comedy bit or something, there'd be a stethoscope pressed up against Azai-san's phone so that everyone could hear what Tsubaki was saying.”
“Usami-san... sometimes you're kinda dumb...”
I lower my voice.
“Are you really okay?”
“Yeah, I'm okay. Sorry, I'll call the teacher immediately to apologize.”
So we're back to square one.
“I see. So I guess you don't really trust me.”
I said this in a nonchalant manner.
“Huh?”
“We're supposed to stick together in times of crisis, right? Why aren't you telling me anything? Are we not friends?”
It's really quite simple.
“Sorry...”
An innocent girl like Tsubaki can be easily shaken with words like trust and friendship.
“Please talk to me. We're close enough for that, aren't we?”
“...!”
I can picture Tsubaki's pained and guilty look on the other end of the line.
“I'm... I'm sorry... but this is a family matter.”
“A family matter?”
Her explanation made no sense to me.
“...We've discussed your family matters before, haven't we? You had no problem talking about the possibility of having to move...”
In other words, this new issue is many times worse than that.
“But I can't talk... not about this...”
Did someone in the family die?
No... if that was true, she could just say it.
There's no doubt that something outside the scope of my imagination has happened.
Something downright out of the ordinary. What could it be, though...?
“Class is about to start.”
I decided to wrap up the call.
“I need to hang up now. I'll ask one last time. Do you want my help?”
“......”
Tsubaki didn't answer.
Even though she doesn't answer, it seems she doesn't want to hang up either.
In other words...
“I'm hanging up...”
“Ah...”
At the same moment that I ended the call, the bell for class rang.
“...What happened?”
“How did it go?”
I thought for a bit, and said,
“At the very least, I need to go over to her house.”
“So to put it simply, there's some trouble surrounding Tsubaki?”
“Yeah... she must be dealing with a very difficult problem.”
“What about class?”
“...Does it matter?”
“(You really do come off as a main character, rushing out to help a friend in need.)”
“Got it. I really don't want to cut class, but... I'll go too.”
“If you don't want to miss class, don't come.”
“No, no...”
Usami delightedly plays with her hair.
“Still, Azai-san, you normally seem like a cold person, but on the inside you're on fire.”
“What're you smirking about...? Let's get going.”
They don't understand anything.
Something happened to Tsubaki's family.
The first thing that comes to mind is that it's somehow related to this land conflict.
As one of the people with a stake in that land, I have to rush over there and grasp the situation as fast as possible.
The three of us get off the platform at the Eastern District station.
Tsubaki's house should be nearby.
I need to keep my guard up in case things get violent.
“Tsubaki-chaaan!”
In the midst of my thoughts, Eiichi yells loudly.
“Hey, cut it...”
“We're here to see you!”
He then rings the doorbell.
“......”
For a moment, there was silence.
“Tsubaki was home not long ago, correct?”
“Yeah. Do you think she just left?”
“In any case, this looks pretty bad.”
Usami pointed at the window.
“The curtains have been drawn.”
“I see. Whatever happened was so bad that they have to close the curtains in the middle of the day...”
Just as I was admiring Usami's observational skills, the door suddenly opened.
“...Guys...”
Her face was as white as a ghost.
“Can we come in?”
“Huh?”
“Surely you won't say no after inviting us all the way out here.”
Well, we weren't exactly invited...
“Don't worry～, you can talk to me about anything. And I'll have beef and potato stew in exchange.”
Come to think of it, it really is rare for Eiichi to ask for any food besides sweets.
Is their stew really that good?
“Thank you... but first, come in.”
When we entered the living room, her father appeared.
“Oh, it's you guys...”
Why is the breadwinner of the family not working at this time of day?
...Because he's self-employed?
But even then, something's strange.
Tsubaki, her father, and her siblings all sit in the family room.
But her mother's not there.
“Did something happen to your mother?”
“Huh? Oh, Mom's laying down in the bedroom...”
“......”
I looked at Usami.
What sharp eyes.
She's searching the immediate vicinity.
“Thank you for worrying about Tsubaki's health, but you really should head back. School's still in session, isn't it?”
Her father's words sound very forced.
He pulls out the chair near the phone and sits there with a heavy look.
“......”
A gaggle of formerly rowdy kids also sits there silently.
One seems to be sleeping, one playing with toy blocks absentmindedly, and another one clinging to Tsubaki's leg.
The whole room seems dead.
“Huh?”
Only Eiichi, who seems to be ignoring the somber atmosphere, manages to blurt something out.
“That little punk... I mean, that...”
“Exactly...”
As if following Eiichi's lead, Usami nods her head.
“That kid we were looking for the day before yesterday isn't here.”
“H-Hiroaki's at kindergarten right now!”
Did something happen to Hiroaki...?
As I was about to say that out loud, Usami quietly said,
“So only Hiroaki-kun went to kindergarten?”
Indeed, all the other kids are still home.
“...!”
“Tsubaki, please send them home. This has nothing to do with your friends.”
“I... I know, but...”
“Sir, why do you hesitate to leave the phone?”
“What?”
“Why would your wife be sleeping right now? And what's with all the somber looks on the kids' faces? Why won't you tell us what's going on?”
“Haru-chan...”
“Tsubaki.”
I gulped.
That one-in-a-million possibility passed through my mind.
“He's been kidnapped, hasn't he?”
“What!?”
“Sir, you're waiting for the kidnapper to call, correct?”
“And your wife is bedridden from the shock.”
“You still haven't called the police, and the kidnapper specifically told you not to call the police, isn't that so? That's why you're at a loss.”
“Uuuh...”
Tsubaki looks like she's about to cry.
“It happened yesterday...”
“Hey, Tsubaki!”
“If only... I'd gone... to the kindergarten earlier...!”
Last night would be... after she had coffee with me...?
“When I arrived at the kindergarten, they said Hiroaki already went home...”
“Enough, Tsubaki. This isn't your fault.”
“Hiroaki once tried to walk home from kindergarten. I was late picking him up that day, so he just came home by himself...”
I'm also partly to blame for Tsubaki getting there late...
But, I never would have guessed he could be kidnapped...
It's far too unreal.
Is this what they call the moment when everything goes wrong?
“And?”
In this crowded room, only Usami remains calm.
“How can you be certain that Hiroaki-kun has been kidnapped?”
“We were searching forever, but Hiroaki didn't come home by nightfall. And then we suddenly got a phone call...”
“Did that person say something like, ‘I've taken your son?’”
“Y-yes. I happened to be the one who answered the phone...”
“Did you hear Hiroaki-kun's voice?”
“No, I didn't...”
“Then... then... maybe he wasn't kidnapped...?”
“However, the reality is that Hiroaki-kun hasn't come home. And there was a call from a person claiming to be the kidnapper. Undoubtedly, he has been kidnapped.”
“What concerns me is Hiroaki-kun's safety.”
Tsubaki's surely more concerned about that than Usami.
“Sir, if you get another call, please confirm that right away.”
I get the feeling that at some point the atmosphere of the room started to revolve around Usami.
“What are the culprit's demands?”
“Well... he wants a ransom of fifty million yen... that's all he said.”
“I see... in that case, he'll definitely contact you again.”
I know what Usami's getting at.
He has to somehow get that fifty million... basically, the criminal has not yet spoken about how the ransom will be handed over.
Still, kidnapping...
This is a genuine crime.
Even I, one who is always working in the gray area of commerce, was shocked.
Also, I need to ensure that a certain thing doesn't happen.
“Wait a minute. What about the police?”
Exactly, the police.
“We haven't...”
“Did the kidnapper expressly tell you not to call the police?”
“Yes. If we call the police, then Hiroaki will...”
Well, that's standard procedure for a kidnapper.
“I keep agonizing over whether or not I should call the police.”
“No! We can't, Dad! If the kidnapper finds out we called the police, Hiroaki will...!”
“But can we do anything other than leave this to the police?”
“......”
Usami silently watched the exchange between father and daughter.
Trying not to raise any suspicions on myself, I spoke calmly.
“...Please think twice about calling the police.”
“They're professionals: specialists at catching criminals. We're just regular people. Why shouldn't we let them deal with it?”
Tsubaki's father is clearly becoming upset.
To use such mannerisms in front of his daughter's friend, he really has lost control of his emotions.
“Please calm down, Sir. You are correct. In fact, you can say it's a citizen's duty to call the police in the event of a crime.”
“But... how can I put this...?”
I need to convince him.
...Calling the police would be very problematic.
Because if the police come, they'll investigate all of Tsubaki's family's problems.
The kidnapper's motives, and why he chose Tsubaki's family, would likely come to light.
The fact that this family is being pushed into selling their property would doubtlessly come up during the process of investigation.
And then an investigation into Sannou Corporation's land development department would doubtlessly lead to information about the Azai Corporation's involvement.
If the public found out there's a relationship between a legitimate company like Sannou and a shady one like Azai, all joint projects between our organizations would cease immediately.
It's impossible to stay afloat in this city if the Sannou Corporation won't have anything to do with you.
And naturally, my own position in the company would be put in a precarious state as well.
Therefore, I must prevent any police intervention at all cost.
“Is there any guarantee that relying on the police will bring Hiroaki back?”
“Well... er, yes, I'm sure the police could do something about this.”
I slowly shake my head.
“Remember that I told you a little about my father?”
“Ah, yes. He's the owner of a finance and real estate company, right?”
“I believe he was a policeman before that.”
“Really?”
I think Gonzou really was a police officer. He worked in a department that dealt with organized crime.
I hear that it's not unusual for a policeman in charge of organized crime countermeasures to retire into the yakuza. But then again, I haven't heard this directly from Gonzou himself.
Now then, borrowing my father's authority was a good move, but how do I change over to the main topic...? It's about time to cut to the chase...
“I heard from my father once... that kidnapping cases, when reported to the police... well, they tend to produce casualties.”
“Casualties?”
“Yes...”
“C-casualties... that's...”
“Dad. We really can't call the police.”
I'm not lying about this.
Obviously, my last statement painted an image in their minds of Hiroaki in some sort of danger.
However, in a kidnapping case, the kidnapped person and the threatened family are all ‘casualties’.
One cannot measure the psychological pain and suffering family members go through.
For this reason, whether the police become involved or not, kidnappings are bound to have casualties.
“B-but... at least the police would certainly arrest the criminal.”
“Are you okay with just arresting the criminal? Isn't the highest priority to bring Hiroaki-kun back home?”
“Hmmm...”
Tsubaki's father held his head.
“Still, Azai-san.”
“What?”
“There's no guarantee that Hiroaki-kun will come back if we don't contact the police.”
Damn...
“You seem to be very particular about preventing police intervention.”
“Well, Papa is a former police officer, so... it looks like I said a bit too much.”
“Really...?”
Usami stares at me with her unblinking eyes.
“When it comes to kidnapping, the police catch the criminal ninety five percent of the time.”
“......”
“And for the other five percent, the criminals don't get the ransom.”
“In this country, there's not a single kidnapper who went up against the police and managed to get the ransom.”
...Son of a bitch. Where did you get all these statistics?
“What are you trying to say?”
“If we call the police, we can say with a probability close to certainty that the money will come back.”
“Fifty million...”
While mumbling to myself, I had a flash of inspiration.
Quite a devilish conception.
However, with this, I'll be able to steal the Miwa household.
“Is something wrong, Azai-san?”
“No, it's nothing...”
Be calm. Stay calm.
I pretended to have a dizzy spell and shook my head.
“By the way, Usami.”
“Yes?”
Usami's eyes never left me during all this time.
“I want to know more details about kidnapping cases.”
“Yes?”
“You just said that at the very least, we can guarantee the ransom won't be taken, right?”
“Yes.”
“In other words, although the money was safe, something else was not. Can I interpret it that way?”

“...!?”
At that moment, Usami's expression clearly changed.
When Eiichi and I stole the school keys, she seemed somehow different from usual when questioning us.
But still, that was nothing compared to this.
In fact, the aura she was emitting could easily be described as murderous intent.
“Very astute, Azai-san. Such cases have indeed occurred.”
“......”
“Since the post-war period in Japan, there have been roughly one hundred and eighty kidnappings on record.”
“The number of casualties among these was over thirty.”
“Th-thirty... people...?”
“That's roughly a twenty-percent mortality rate...”
“How could it... no. Dad, we mustn't...”
“Right. Even though it's only twenty percent, this is your little brother we're talking about...”
I can't get that spark of inspiration from earlier out of my mind.
I did feel a bit of resistance to the idea...
But I would love for the kidnapper to get his fifty million.
Fifty million isn't a small figure.
I don't believe the family has that much in savings.
In which case they have no choice but to get a loan from a bank.
When that happens, I'm sure they'll have to put up this land as collateral.
And if the kidnapper steals that fifty million, they won't get it back.
Then, Tsubaki and her family will have no choice but to leave their house.
This presents yet another reason police involvement would trouble me.
Still, in the end, I can't help but feel resistant to the whole thing.
Because this would mean I'm condoning a genuine crime.
“Well, I can't say that there aren't any kidnapping cases in Japan that never got reported to the police.”
“And I believe there are even organized crime rings who systematically kidnap people in other countries. And as professionals, they would indeed release hostages if the families didn't report to the police. As long as they got the ransom, of course.”
“Why don't we try reexamining this after evaluating the kidnapper's next move?”
Usami is one hundred percent calm right now.
She's calm, but it looks as if something in the core of her heart is blazing fiercely.
“Tsubaki, you also oppose calling the police, right?”
“Yes. After all, he told me not to call the police.”
Tsubaki seems to believe even the words of a vile kidnapper.
This is a good example of how sincerity can sometimes be no more than foolishness.
“Anyway, all of you should leave. This is a family matter, after all.”
I cannot allow that.
My wicked heart is jeering me on, telling me not to squander this opportunity.
“Sir, please let me help.”
“Azai-kun...”
“I'm also partly to blame for Tsubaki's tardiness in picking up Hiroaki yesterday.”
“That's not true! It had nothing to do with you!”
“Don't bother, Tsubaki. It turned out this way because I asked you to treat me to a cup of coffee.”
I lowered my eyes.
“That aside, Sir, how do you plan on assembling the ransom?”
“Ransom?”
“Whether you rely on the police or not, I still think there's a need to prepare the fifty million.”
“It's such a huge amount of money. We...”
“I'll try asking my father. If I explain the circumstances, I think he'll loan you the money at a low interest rate.”
Of course, I'll make sure you use this land as collateral.
“Well...”
He seemed to be at a loss for words.
Maybe it's because he has nowhere else to turn. He can only sigh in dejection.
“Tsubaki, would you also be willing to let me handle this?”
When I say I feel partly to blame for the kidnapping, I'm not lying.
...So from among the lenders under the Souwa Alliance umbrella, I plan to choose one that's relatively decent.
“Azai-kun, thank you...”
Tears well up in Tsubaki's eyes.
Her father sits, speechless.
......
...
“Well, well, that was pretty extreme even for me.”
Afterward, the three of us left. For now, we'll wait for the kidnapper to call again.
Usami and I parted at the Eastern District's park.
On the way back, Usami didn't say a single word. She seemed to be thinking that whole time.
“Come to think of it, weren't you pretty quiet that whole time?”
“C'mon man, I try to be a guy who can at least gauge the mood in a room. You know what I mean? Even I know not to talk when I have nothing useful to say.”
“Actually, I think you're just about the most oblivious guy I know. Anyway, keep your mouth shut about this.”
“I'm telling you, I get it. I won't even tell my pets.”
Suddenly, Eiichi stopped in his tracks.
“Still... you think Tsubaki's gonna be okay?”
“What's this all of a sudden?”
“It's just so terrible. Kidnapping... makes me wonder if I'm an actor in some tragic drama...”
“It came as a shock to me, too.”
“You think there's anything I can do to help?”
“......”
“What, did I say something strange?”
“It's just... don't you usually treat younger women like bitches?”
“Yeah... but what can I say, Bro, I like pets.”
...I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but it seems that even Eiichi is worried about Tsubaki.
“I'm going home.”
“Yeah.”
“Oh yeah, maybe I should buy Tsubaki some pudding. Yeah, she seems simple, so it should make her happy. See how thoughtful I am?”
He leaves mumbling to himself.
Alright, I still have things to take care of. No rest for the wicked.
But before that, I need to pay Gonzou a visit.
I need him to give me the name of a good loaner...
I await the train to the Southern District.
“......”
Still, even someone like Eiichi is a good person at heart.
...What about me?
After arriving at Gonzou's house, I explained the circumstances.
“...So in summary, if Miwa Tsubaki's household uses its land as collateral for the loan, everything will be dealt with tidily.”
“......”
“Therefore, could you introduce me to someone who could prepare fifty million right away?”
“......”
Gonzou didn't agree to anything, he just held his dignified posture.
“...What do you think, Father?”
“......”
“...Father?”
His heavy mouth remained shut.
“......”
Feeling a little scared, I gulped.
“Kidnapping, huh?”
“......”
“That's a felony.”
“Y-yes.”
“You could take this to the police.”
His words were hiding something, and his voice held a coercive tone.
“If they call the police, detectives from the special investigations unit of the prefecture's main branch will come out here.”
“They're professionals at kidnapping countermeasures. It's been beaten into them to not allow any failures in the investigation.”
“The investigation team could simultaneously have three hundred people look into the matter. Their ability to trace phone calls and analyze voices has dramatically improved. Most of all, this prefecture's branch cooperates well with the police superintendent.”
“There's no doubt the criminal would be caught.”
He's saying this calmly, as if he's directly seen the inner workings of police.
“Indeed. That is why I want to absolutely prevent any police intervention.”
“Oh?”
“As long as the kidnapper takes the money, they'd have to move away.”
When I said that, my mood turned sour.
“Are you alright with that?”
“What do you mean?”
“What I mean is, are you willing to approve of this crime?”
It's as if he saw right through the hesitation in my heart...
“Well...”
“Kidnapping is one of the most despicable crimes. One takes an innocent hostage, and then extorts unjust demands. Compound that; the hostage is a five-year-old, that makes it even worse.”
What's he getting at?
“Are you alright with that, Kyousuke?”
A chill went through my spine.
I understand.
Gonzou's testing me.
He's questioning my conscience, testing my capacity as his livestock.
That thought cleared my mind.
“...To be honest, I'm a bit hesitant.”
At that moment, a heavy gust of wind suddenly blew past me.
Sparks flew before my eyes.
“Gh... ahhh...!”
My vision suddenly went white.
An acidic taste filled the inside of my mouth.
I couldn't move.
It was like the strength to maintain my body was leaking out through all my pores.
A sharp pain ran through my head.
Did he pull me up by my hair...?
“You worthless piece of shit...!!!”
His cold eyes were bottomless.
“Why won't you commit to either good or evil!?”
I was terrified.
My whole body froze. Even the blood in my veins iced over.
Confusion, agitation, any negative emotion you can name, I'm feeling that right now.
“Didn't you save that Miwa Tsubaki girl once?”
“Guh, ah... huh?”
I don't know what he's talking about――the only thing I could comprehend was his menace.
“You used my name as a front when you called those pornographers downtown, didn't you!?”
Now that you mention it...
Bearing such intense pressure, I slowly pieced together the events that happened that day.
I'm pretty sure there was a time when Tsubaki got tricked by a scout on Central Boulevard.
I used the Azai Corporation's name and instructed him not to lay a finger on Tsubaki.
“Why did you help her back then?”
He violently shakes my head.
“Why, after all this time, is your conscience making you waver?”
“Urg... ahh...”
He finally releases me.
“Listen carefully, Kyousuke. From the moment you decided to follow me, the only thing that awaited you was Hell.”
“Yes...”
“Don't you need money?”
“Yes.”
“Aren't you going to pay back your parents' debt!?”
“Yes!”
“How much is it!?”
“Two hundred million!”
My father's, Samejima Toshikatsu's, debt.
It was only fifty million at the time, but it had a hell of an interest rate attached, and swelled up like a snowball.
“Then go make some goddamned money! It's just two hundred million!”
That's right...
I followed Gonzou in order to pay back my father's debt.
Everyone who knows about that says,
‘What an amazing child... to do such a thing for his father...’
But it's no such beautiful story.
Paying back money to the yakuza requires severe life-or-death tactics and bargaining.
Two hundred million yen.
This isn't some amount you can casually deposit into a bank.
And the longer I wait, the more interest it will accumulate.
“I understand...”
The sense of terror rapidly lessened.
The need for the money has gotten to the point where I've had to consensually sell my soul. This accursed attachment to money pushes me on.
There's still only fifty million yen in my safe...
“I will not fail.”
Satisfied with my answer, Gonzou deeply nods.
“Good, now that's the face of a human.”
I finally have the resolve.
No longer will I think about Tsubaki.
I can only walk my own path.
Of course, I know that my path leads to Hell.
......
...
Perhaps it's because of all the excitement, but my head started to hurt.
After leaving Gonzou's place, I stumble toward Central Boulevard.
My consciousness was muddled.
I let the headache run its course.
...
......
My headache's finally gone.
My mind is clearing up.
This complex, connected sensation felt akin to that of passing the baton off to someone else.
It's only recently that I've become aware of the existence of ‘Azai’ Kyousuke.
My other half.
When I, ‘Maou’, am not acting openly, ‘Azai’ Kyousuke works to support me.
This only strengthens my belief that this kidnapping plan will surely succeed.
Now then...
I dial a number on my phone.
Needless to say, that number belonged to Tsubaki's residence.
Someone picked up immediately.
“You didn't contact the police, did you?”
Although I'm confident in my ability to change my voice to a certain extent, I still use a voice changer to be extra certain.
It would be incredibly troublesome if my natural voice was analyzed.
The police might already be at their house, tracing this call literally as we speak.
“No! I didn't!”
“Really?”
“Yes! Really!”
“Good.”
And then I hung up.
I'm not stupid enough to just trust someone else's words.
I know that it takes about three minutes to successfully trace a call.
When the criminal places a call, the detectives can contact the technical staff at the telephone company and run a check on all the circuits governing the area containing Tsubaki's house.
Then, by confirming the status on a certain switchboard, they can specify the caller's location.
If the length of the call is sufficient, they can detect anywhere from a general range within which the call is being made to calculating the specific phone number used.
Also, if the criminal calls from the same area as the victim's family, it takes less time to search the circuits.
But if it's long distance, which requires several switchboards to route the call, it would take longer to trace the number.
However...
If the call goes by way of the recent electronic, digital switchboards, they'll know where it came from in an instant.
So I took the safest possible course of action.
Just now, I placed the call from my cell phone.
Since I was moving during the call, even if the police have my specific location, I'll have gotten away before they can rush over here.
This cell phone is itself a disposable model, so it'd be meaningless to confirm the owner.
Once more, I dialed the number for Tsubaki's house.
“Hello, this is the Miwa family!”
“After this, I'll call two more times. Before then, be sure to prepare pen and paper.”
“Huh? What!?”
She's probably flustered from the sudden direction.
“You're not allowed to ask any questions, understand?”
“Not, not allowed... what about Hiroaki? Please let me hear Hiroaki's voice!”
I cut the connection.
If there is a detective next to Tsubaki, he should instruct her to draw out the call.
Why would a kidnapper actually acquiesce to such demands?
Anyway, I should change my location.
I don't think those short conversations will allow them to track my location, but there's no harm in being extra careful.
I'm now near my home.
This place should use a different switchboard to route the call.
No matter what, I must prevent the police from interfering.
I call on my cell phone.
Again I hear Tsubaki's crying voice.
“Hello! What about Hiroaki? Is he okay!?”
I already told her that questions were not permitted, but I guess she's too worried to care right now...
“Before instructing you on how to hand over the ransom money, I'll say this one more time.”
I persistently repeated the same command.
“Don't contact the police. If there's any sign of police presence, I'll cancel the trade, and your brother won't come back. Do you understand?”
Not having the police involved is an absolute condition.
Why do kidnappers on TV and in mystery novels always try to fight the police?
Naturally, it's to make the stories more entertaining.
But in real life, no kidnapper has managed to successfully escape the police with the ransom.
No crime carries more risk than kidnapping.
If I even find a trace of the police, I'll cancel the trade.
That's what I've decided.
The most crucial point in performing a successful crime is understanding when to pull back.
“I didn't contact the police! So please give me back my brother!”
Her painful cry grated my ears.
If she's lying, then she must be a top-level actress.
“Very good. In that case, wait for my next phone call.”
“W-wait, wait a minute...”
I break off the connection while continuing forward.
I'll change my location again.
Silence blankets the shoreline at night.
They ought to be growing impatient right about now.
This is the last confirmation.
When someone picked up, I didn't use the voice changer. Instead, I just changed my own pitch.
“Hello, is this the Miwa residence?”
“Huh? Ah, y-yes!”
“I'm Takano of the special investigations unit. Can I speak to Detective Tomita?”
“Huh...?”
There was a pause.
I focus all my attention to my ear.
“Eh, po-police?”
“Well? Officer Tomita should be the female officer in charge of on-site investigations there.”
“Ah... w-what? D-Dad!?”
I can hear hectic noises in the backdrop.
“Dad, when did you contact the police!?”
“What!? What did you say!?”
That exchange satisfied me.
From Tsubaki's reaction, it's very hard to imagine a detective standing next to her.
I used the voice changer again.
“Looks like you did as I said, and didn't contact the police.”
“Ah...”
“If you had said something like, ‘Hold on a second...’ your brother would've left this world by now.”
The police would never call a family victimized by kidnapping in order to get in contact with a coworker.
Naturally, they're provided with special wireless phones to keep in touch.
“You, you deceived me!?”
This is indeed a cheap trick that anyone in their right mind would quickly see through. But for someone in Tsubaki's state of mind, it's more than enough as a test.
“That's good, make sure you keep it up. Though after getting a glimpse of the special gift you should be receiving shortly, I doubt you'll even think about contacting the police anyway.”
“Gift?”
I ignore her question.
Eiichi caught me first thing the next morning.
“Hey, so what are the plans for the party?”
“It doesn't really matter to me. It's all good as long as I'm free.”
“Then let's do it today.”
“Well, that's rather sudden...”
“But, isn't there a festival tomorrow?”
“...Oh, right...”
“You're planning a party?”
“Yup. You should come, it's at my house.”
“I totally will. It sounds fun!”
Usami then appeared out of nowhere.
“Tsubaki, are you alright?”
“What do you mean?”
“You don't look very well.”
Indeed, two black circles ornamented Tsubaki's eyes.
“I'm fine. What about you, Haru-chan? Your hair is all over the place.”
Tsubaki responded with a smile.
“Then, about the party...”
“I have to bring Hiroaki home first. I'll be a bit late.”
“That's cool. I'll forgive you if you bring a present.”
“Would a mandarin orange do? They're really sweet, you know?”
“Ah... mandarin... oranges... me... love oranges.”
“What are you, a caveman...?”
“You're coming too, right Haru-chan?”
“Yeah...”
Usami looked at Tsubaki with a serious face.
“...Should I decline?”
“Why? Is there something you have to do?”
“...I see.”
Usami kept silent after that.
“Should we invite Kanon...?”
“No, let it be. Kanon-chan's very busy with her skating practices. I didn't leave her out just out of cruelty, if that's what you're thinking. Definitely not.”
“...I guess you're right. The tournament's coming up soon...”
Yet, the person in question――Kanon――was napping on her desk.
“Well then, what will you be bringing as a present, Kyousuke-kun?”
“You have poisonous snakes, right? How about a mongoose?”
“It's not a poisonous snake. But if you think you can bring a mongoose I'd just like to see you try.”
...Hmm, have I been playing around too much recently?
There are no major jobs right now, so it doesn't matter, but still...
coming, right?”
...Tsubaki's pale face worries me.
“Hey, Tsubaki...”
I spoke as though it wasn't important.
“I get the feeling that you're becoming more ordinary...”
“Huh? Is that so?”
“Yeah... but it's not a bad thing.”
What I meant was, she was becoming more normal.
Without that strange naivety, it was actually easier to communicate with her.
I felt that Tsubaki and I were growing closer.
“...Is it... strange?”
Tsubaki asked uneasily.
“No, it's actually for the better. Keep it up, we'll have some good times yet.”
Tsubaki smiled brightly in relief.
“Yeah, we will.”
“Hey, just who do you two think you are? Stop trying to liven things up. I'll have you know that I'm the host here, that's my job.”
Time flies, and classes ended in the blink of an eye.
Sunset came earlier each day.
“Well, I'm heading home.”
“Yeah, see you!”
Tsubaki left before the rest of us.
“Come to think of it, I have work.”
“Oh? You're not coming?”
“Sorry. I could've worked with my schedule if you had asked me earlier...”
“No, you should've just declined earlier!”
...She must be trying to be considerate to Tsubaki.
“I'm not trying to avoid Tsubaki, alright?”
“......”
“But... I'm worried about her.”
“Worried?”
“She looks really tired these days.”
“That's why I'm trying to heat things up today.”
“That's what you do best, Eiichi-san. Personally, I'm really good at freezing things over.”
Usami played with her long, shaggy hair.
“Is everything okay with Tsubaki's dad?”
“Tsubaki's dad? Why are you worried about her family?”
“Call it a gut feeling, I guess.”
She claimed to be worried, but her face remained as blank as always.
“Think about it. Don't people in the same family generally resemble each other?”
“......”
“Take you, for example. An outstanding father like yours is bound to have an outstanding son. In a lot of ways.”
“What are you trying to say?”
This girl has no idea about Gonzou.
“Well, when Tsubaki's tired, her family probably is too... yes, just like her reflection in a mirror, they've got to be exhausted.”
“Like a reflection in a mirror, you say...?”
This phrase really clung to my mind.
“So, are your parents as strange as you?”
“How rude... don't you already know?”
“Why would I know anything about your parents?”
...Christ. Usami's always talking such nonsense.
Mirrors? Give me a break.
“Well, I'll see you later. Azai-san, there's something I need to tell you next time I see you, so be ready for it.”
“What the hell? Just say it now.”
“Oh, sorry, that was just a silly little joke.”
“Just go to work already!”
I waved to her as she walked away.
“What do we do now?”
“Hm. You're right, a party with only you and me would be...”
“A sausage fest, seriously. It would be awful with only me, you, and Charlie.”
...Looks like we need some girls.
“Call some of your friends. Like, a mature female doctor or something.”
“Eh-...?”
“Um, how about that girl Miki-chan? Your F-W-B.”
“Miki-chan's not my ‘F-W-B’. That's out of the question.”
Speaking of which, I haven't talked to Miki in a good while.
I wonder what's been going on in that neck of the woods?
“Then why don't we go find some chick off the street before Tsubaki comes over? It'll be easy with your money and my intelligence.”
“Sounds like a pain in the ass.”
“C'mon, quit stalling. Let's go.”
“H-hey, let go of me...”
We arrived on Central Boulevard.
Eiichi got all fired up as we headed for the thickest part of the crowd.
“Hey, Babe.”
Eiichi swished his finger and pointed.
“How's about you and me grab a bite to eat?”
Oh please, you don't just stand in front of a random girl and say that...
As expected, the girl left in a hurry with a disgusted look on her face.
“Tch, stupid bitch!”
“Look, Eiichi-san...”
“What? Show me some effort. And some money, too.”
“Use your brain.”
“You tryin' to tell me what to do?”
“Your selling point is cuteness. Make use of that potential of yours.”
“Alright, fine.”
Then again, working the cute angle won't really get you anywhere with skirt chasing.
“Hey, Sis...”
Eiichi found another mark a short while later.
“Hey, could you listen to me for a sec? I'm learning to read palms. Can I have a bit of your time?”
The girl didn't even look at Eiichi.
“Hey, Kid, what's up with the palm reading?”
“It's my trademark pull. Girls always get a kick out of divination.”
...This joker's hopeless.
My phone suddenly rang.
“Yes, hello...?”
“A-Azai-kun, sorry.”
It was Tsubaki.
“Sorry, I'm going to be even later than I thought.”
“Did something come up?”
“Mm-mm. It's just, Hiroaki...”
“Huh?”
“Um, he wants me to play with him.”
Right, Hiroaki did mention something like that last night.
“Then call me later. We'll just find something to do in the meantime.”
“Sorry. I'll rush there as soon as I can.”
There's no need to rush...
But she hung up as I was about to tell her that.
“What did she say?”
“Tsubaki said she'll be coming a bit later than she said she would. Apparently she has to play with her brother.”
“Ah, that brother again. What a selfish twerp.”
“All kids are like that.”
“It must be really hard on Tsubaki. She never has any time to herself.”
“You're probably right.”
“I mean, the girl doesn't even use makeup. Her style stays practically the same all year. Well, that's why I have a high opinion of her, I guess.”
“You, a high opinion?”
“I know, right? I guess it's something about the pure and honest feel to her, like, ‘I might be poor, but I work hard.’ Isn't that just so moe?”
“Is it...?”
I, on the other hand, wasn't so fond of that part of her.
That was the Tsubaki from the past.
“Ah, I'm tired of asking people out. Let's go kill time at the arcade.”
“Whatever, I don't care. I'm only watching, though.”
Arcades are only a waste of money.
We decided to wander around Central Boulevard until Tsubaki called.
“Doesn't she realize it's already ten?”
“Who knows...?”
Tsubaki still hasn't called.
“Let's just cancel it. It might be a little rude to Tsubaki, but I can't take this anymore.”
“Fair enough. I'll call her and pass it on.”
“Then I'm going home.”
“Sure.”
Eiichi disappeared in an instant.
“......”
I'll head home soon too, but let's take care of some business first, shall we?
It wouldn't hurt to show up at the company, either.
Top management has been doing a real good job lately, so there hasn't been much need for me to butt in.
They've asked for my advice a few times.
My advice didn't mean anything, of course. I guess they just wanted to make use of Gonzou's influence...
An hour had already passed before Tsubaki called.
“It's pretty late, you know.”
“Sorry, what are y'all up to now?”
“Eh, we gave up a long time ago.”
I could feel Tsubaki's anxiety even through the phone.
“Ah... is that so? Haah...”
“C'mon, we can have a party any day.”
“How does tomorrow sound, Azai-kun?”
“Huh?”
“Are you free tomorrow?”
“What's the matter?”
“Um... I wanted to make up for today...”
“You want to go out again?”
“Well, but that's not all. I think Dad wants to talk to you.”
“...Your father?”
Could it be about the land?
“Alright. I'll come to your house. Would it be okay to come over before noon?”
“That'd be great. And... I would really appreciate it if you could go out with me after that.”
...She's got her heart set on a date with me, apparently.
“Yeah, sounds good.”
For some reason, I seem to be relaxing my guard around Tsubaki.
I'm starting to believe that it might be alright to tell her about my other side.
Not everything, mind you, but perhaps just a little bit wouldn't hurt.
It might be an opportunity to get things off my chest and gain someone I can discuss things with.
Tsubaki seems to be at my beck and call anyway.
I've never liked her until recently, when she started to have an interest in topics that relate to money.
“Want to eat at a slightly classier restaurant than usual?”
“Huh? Is that an invitation?”
“We'll pay Dutch, of course, but yeah. You've got some savings, right?”
“A good amount, actually. Never thought of how I could spend it until now, though. Maybe you can teach me.”
“I can teach you quite a few bad things.”
I replied with a joke. Tsubaki seemed cheerful, too.
“Right. Listen, Hiroaki finally fell asleep just now...”
“Is that why you ended up calling so late?”
“Yes. It seems like this happens every time...”
“Just your luck, huh?”
“Maybe. The same goes for class. I've always been the representative, but I've been thinking lately, ‘Why me?’”
This conversation looks like it'll be here for the long haul.
“Then... Dad, he...”
I sank deeply into conversation with Tsubaki as I made my way home.
“Ah, I need to continue packing for the move. It'd be nice if Dad helped more...”
Tsubaki started complaining.
Even her tone changed.
I felt like I had trampled over something precious, but that only served to tickle my sadistic urges.
I had tasted for the first time the pleasure that comes from defiling others.
The entire sensation felt a bit base.
Nevertheless, dragging a pure girl like Tsubaki down to my level left me with an ecstatic grin.
The first thing I did the next morning was send a letter and some cash to Mom.
After I got home, I dangled the DVD I rented in front of Kanon.
“It's the one you wanted.”
“Good work.”
Kanon gets up really early.
And despite the fact that she's taking a day off, she still bothered to take the time to perfect her personal appearance this morning.
“Would you like some pastries?”
“That's so considerate～, but just water is fine with me.”
She might look like a complete fool, but she still takes good care of her body.
“Well, then. I'll be in the study...”
“Let's watch it together!”
“No.”
“Okay!”
She knows where the line is.
“Just shout if anything comes up.”
I pressed the play button on the DVD player and disappeared into the study.
......
...
After around two hours, I returned to the living room.
The movie's credits were scrolling up the screen.
I hadn't heard anything for a while, so I thought she might have fallen asleep again...
“I finished it.”
“Oh, how was it?”
“...I cried.”
“You did not, you liar. You fell asleep, didn't you?”
“I told you, I finished it. The mom died in the end. It's so sad when a good person dies.”
“I see... I haven't seen it.”
“Alright, question time!”
“Huh? What?”
“The mother in this movie was a good person, but what if she had been a bad person?”
“Uh, I don't know... it'd make the movie kind of tedious, I guess.”
“Tedious...”
“I mean, if a bad person dies, people just scoff and move on, right?”
“Right.”
“......”
“That's right.”
“What's on your mind, Kanon?”
“Eh, you know... what we should do next. What do you want to do?”
“How about we grab some lunch?”
“Where?”
“I don't know yet, so let's just head for Central Boulevard for now...”
“Got it! I'll go get ready!”
She thundered off to the washroom.
...She's pretty passive for someone so selfish.
I was very uncomfortable with taking Kanon out.
The girls on the streets always point and whisper, and even the middle aged salarymen look at us with pursed lips.
“Look, Kanon, can you take like three steps away from me?”
“No thank you.”
“Please? The situation is looking pretty bad right now.”
“Geez, Nii-san, you're too dang gloomy. Do you really hate attention that much?”
“Sure do. I'm petty like that.”
“How are we supposed to go on a date with you like this?”
She followed behind me, pouting.
We eventually made it to the cafe I usually go to.
Nevertheless, the waiter still recognized Kanon. His eyes shot open.
“Oh yeah, I came here with you before～.”
“You did?”
“A year ago.”
“I don't remember that.”
“What? How could you forget the magical day you confessed your love to Non-chan?”
“Quit pulling my leg.”
She giggled and stuck out her tongue.
“What do you want to eat?”
“You decide.”
“I knew you were going to say that.”
I picked some random dishes and turned back to Kanon.
“Hey, what the...!? Wake up! You can't sleep here!”
She had suddenly closed her eyes.
“Ah, sorry, it's meditation time.”
“Meditation?”
“Image training. It's really important. It's going to boost my confidence in my jumps. I'm imagining making a bold start, flowing with the music, timing a jump perfectly, and landing with complete success.”
“Wait... so when you're sleeping in class, you're...?”
“Yup, I'm usually on the ice. In spirit, anyway.”
I suddenly felt like giving her a few more respect points.
“You really are something else, aren't you?”
“Yeah, I'm totally amazing. You can bet your bottom dollar that Non-chan won't mess up.”
“That's a bold thing to say.”
.”
“They care when it comes to someone as famous as you. When someone like you says even the littlest thing, the whole world gossips about it...”
“That's why I love you so much, Nii-san. Even if you complain, you still let me do what I want.”
While giggling, she reached over to try and poke my face.
I pushed away her hand and continued.
“I know that you're always thinking about skating.”
“Nah, it's more like skating's the only thing I understand.”
“You're pretty laid-back, you know that...?”
...Still, it's probably good to know what you can and cannot do.
“Why did you start skating?”
“Because Coach told me to.”
“Now that's a little too laid-back. Was that your only reason?”
“I get asked that a lot. People are always looking for drama, I guess.”
“There's nothing wrong with people wanting to hear some great story about your introduction to skating.”
“If I had to give a reason...”
“If you had to give a reason...?”
“It'd probably be that figure skating is a sport that even a Japanese girl can be the world's best at.”
Ah... foreigners and Japanese have radically different physiques, after all.
“And why did you have to be the world's best?”
“Hmm... well, Coach talked about it everyday.”
“So it's all thanks to Ikuko-san's brilliant education...”
“Because she talks about how she went to the Olympics every night before going to bed.”
“Ikuko-san came in sixth, right?”
“She was always saying that she should have gotten the gold, and that the situation between the Soviet Union and the US was bad back then.”
“And what exactly do international politics have to do with getting the gold?”
“It used to be that six points was the highest you could get, all decided by the judges. It was all based on their opinions back then, and they didn't have people to analyze each technical element like they do now.”
“Right, right.”
“Coach said that the American judge seemed like he was going to give her a high score, so the Russian judge lowered his score to go against the Americans.”
“Seemed like he was going to give a high score...? What? Don't the judges, you know, judge together at the same time? How would anyone know if the American judge was going to give a high score?”
“There's this thing called ‘lobby judging’. It's where the officials, judges, and coaches meet and talk about these things over tea outside of the rink. She said you could pretty much figure it out from there.”
“Oh, come on. If a judge came up with some ridiculous score, then his life as a judge would be over.”
“But he'd be a hero when he got back to his home country. It's a really scary thought.”
“Scary indeed. But the current judging system is fine, right?”
“Who knows? The scoring system was only changed recently. The athletes, coaches, and judges are still getting used to it. To be honest, even Non-chan doesn't know all the details yet.”
...Whoa, whoa.
“But there's no point anymore in a judge trying to cheat. They randomly pick nine of the twelve judges to count, and then drop the highest and lowest scores. Then they take an average of the remaining scores.”
“But if half the judges cheat, then you'd be doomed.”
“If Non-chan loses, then that must be the reason for it.”
She giggled.
Filled to the brim with confidence, until the very end.
At that moment, her rice omelet arrived.
“Lookie, lookie! Michelin Non-chan's gonna give out stars!”
“And just what do you plan on awarding your honors to?”
“First, Nii-san's gloominess... zero stars.”
“Why me?”
“Ah, Nii-san, pass the chopsticks.”
“You don't use chopsticks for omelets.”
“Nii-san's comeback... zero stars.”
“I'm getting mad now...”
“I'll bet. Since you didn't even intend that as a comeback.”
“Hurry up and eat. I have an appointment later this afternoon.”
“'Kay!”
......
...
The sun was already setting by the time the good news came.
After escorting Kanon home, I went to the company headquarters to investigate the Shin'ei Group's most recent movements.
“You found him?”
The call was from Horibe.
Apparently he'd already reported to Gonzou.
“Sure did, Son. We found the rat's nest just now.”
...Already!?
I really have to hand it to these guys... I should have known their senses would be exceptionally sharp amongst these familiar streets.
“But even though you got his address, you still didn't catch him?”
Horibe continued as if ashamed.
“Well you see, there's this kid ‘Shuu’ who works for me...”
It went like this.
A debtor told Shuu that he had seen the accomplice.
Shuu had spread the word that any information would warrant a reward, and that debts could be nullified in part. It was only a verbal agreement, of course, but those ever-hungry, soulless slaves of money nevertheless mobilized with bloodshot eyes and searched for ‘Maou's’ accomplice.
An address turned up in the outskirts of the Central District, where my apartment was.
Earlier this afternoon, as Shuu was searching around, he stumbled upon his prey.
Shuu gave chase immediately, but was attacked as he turned a corner, and lost his target.
Afterward, Horibe rounded up a search team and put some brutal pressure on the people living nearby. After countless interrogations, they finally found the man's apartment.
“Shuu took a knife in the head. That fuck really got him good.”
I can only imagine the cruel smile on Horibe's face right about now.
“Alright, I'll come join you right away.”
“The bastard's name is Saijou. No idea where he went, though. I guess he thinks he can just get away with this...”
Horibe's dark laugh screeched to a halt as I hung up.
I immediately contacted Usami and headed toward the scene.
...
......
Eight P.M.
The place had already been searched.
It was a cheap room in a cheap building.
And it was utterly unsettling.
Black.
The table, cabinets, carpet... everything was pitch black.
Construction paper was pasted over the windows, making it impossible for light to seep into the room.
On one of the walls hung a scroll with the characters for ‘empire’ drawn in calligraphy.
His shelves were lined with massive amounts of books in that same vein, probably serving to fuel his anti-societal ideals even further.
The fact that everything was in neat order only added to the eeriness.
“Sorry I'm late.”
Usami charged in, gasping for air.
“You're more than late. Was it your part-time job?”
“Yeah, I really couldn't get away today... so, what's the situation?”
I gave her a rundown of what happened.
“So, his name is Saijou, huh? What about the yakuza guys?”
“Horibe is leading them to Tokyo Station right now.”
“Tokyo Station? For what, a bullet train?”
“Yeah. Apparently the punk is trying to escape to Hakata.”
“The moment you mention Hakata, I think of the Ming dynasty.”
“Fukuoka, you idiot. Why did you think of ancient China?”
“Wait, how do you know where he's planning to go?”
“I searched the creep's room just now.”
Horibe didn't touch anything once he saw the room was empty, and left the rights to search it to me.
“The first thing we noticed was that the safe had been emptied. The door was left open, and there was nothing but a seal stamp left inside. The closet was open too, and clothes were scattered everywhere.”
“I see, so he took what he could and ran. But that still doesn't explain why you'd think he was headed for the country of pork-bone ramen.”
“The computer was still on. He really was in a rush.”
“Hmm.”
“And he was online, too. The browser was still open.”
“What was Saijou looking at just before he fled?”
“The blog of some random entertainer.”
“No way, was it Fujiwara...? Still, that was probably left up just to fool us.”
“I thought so too, so I checked his history.”
“You thought this out.”
“That brought me straight to the Japan Railways website. I also looked at his search strings, and discovered that he had looked up information about getting a seat on a bullet train to Hakata.”
“It's eight o'clock now... Saijou'd already be on the train, wouldn't he?”
“I'm afraid so. The creep left at four-thirty.”
“Four-thirty? How do you know that?”
“His phone. I hit redial, and a taxi company picked up.”
“I follow you. You asked the company, and they told you he called for a cab to arrive at four-thirty?”
“It takes around an hour and a half to get to Tokyo by taxi. Less than that if you change to a train somewhere along the way.”
“It's eight o'clock now... this is problematic...”
“I don't know if we'll make it or not, but I sent a few people to Haneda Airport in Tokyo.”
“The bullet train to Hakata takes five hours, but it's only an hour and a half by plane. Thus, it's still possible to set up an ambush at Hakata Station. You're good, Azai-san.”
Usami nodded in appreciation, then lifted her finger.
“But there's a little more to it than that.”
“I know. He searched for the bullet train line which terminates at Hakata, but that doesn't mean he's going to get off at Hakata.”
“Very good.”
“All we know is the name of the train line Saijou searched for. I sent people to Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, and all the other stations to cover all the bases.”
Azai Gonzou's Sonoyama Group is a huge organization with over a thousand people.
Certainly, one would need a good number of people in order to secure so many exits, but these people almost lost a blood brother to this man. Thus, no matter how long the journey is, they would bear the suffering.
“Still, if he really escaped to western Japan, we're in quite a bit of trouble.”
“Haha, it's kinda funny to imagine yakuza worrying about ‘jurisdiction’.”
She's right, though. In Hakata, which isn't part of our territory, Souwa men can't just go around grabbing people off the streets like they do here.
“So that's why he chose Hakata. The marinated Alaska pollock roe there is pretty scrumptious, too. This guy has some good ideas.”
She bent down as she joked around.
“What are you doing now!?”
“Going through garbage.”
“Don't tell me you're hunting for clues?”
“Damn straight. I trust that you went through the room thoroughly, so I'll skip ahead to the dirty work.”
Wading in the putrid pile of garbage, she tore open bags with a perfectly calm expression.
“Heh, found it. This looks like a diary about ‘Great Japan’. I guess that makes this Saijou's garbage. Ah, I knew it...”
“Huh? ‘Ah, you knew,’ what?”
“Oh, it's just that our man Saijou's quite careless when he's not following ‘Maou's’ instructions.”
“The blueprint for ‘Maou's’ ‘railway to Hell’ may be perfect, but we can always hope for a mistake from the man laying down the tracks.”
“Especially in the garbage. During everyday life, it'd be strange to see it this way, but this mountain of garbage is actually a mountain of evidence.”
She plunged her hand into the bag, closely examining the contents.
“A mountain of evidence...? But Saijou's already on a bullet train.”
“Yes... your deduction was indeed logical.”
“Is there something still bugging you?”
“I was just thinking that everything's been too easy... eugh, this stinks! I'm gonna have to take a shower after this...”
“Hey, what are you calling ‘easy’?”
“Well, if he was really too hurried to turn off the computer, then why was it turned on in the first place?”
“......”
“And he went to a blog to confuse us. Pretty leisurely, huh? I just can't imagine he was actually short on time.”
She has a point. There was no real need for him to check the railway website from his own room.
It'd be far safer to find a random internet cafe while on the move, and search for information there.
“Plus, he was searching for seat reservations. I could understand doing so if we were in peak travel times, but Christmas is still a bit far off for that. He could just stand if no seats were available...”
“...That's logical.”
“However, if Saijou had really been thinking about getting as far away as possible, all of this would still be reasonable. You never know what someone will do when they're in a panic.”
Perhaps I was a little hurried, too...
“Sorry. I guess I was so focused on getting the clues that I got careless. There's a good chance that ‘Maou's’ true goal was to mislead us into thinking that his man was on his way to Hakata.”
Usami didn't speak, but merely shook her head in response.
Suddenly, her face stiffened.
“......”
She picked up a piece of paper.
“Azai-san, when did you guys get here?”
“I showed up a little after six. Horibe got here a bit earlier...”
Usami stared at the dirty piece of paper.
“‘Your package arrived today at around five, but you weren't here...’ End quote.”
...What the fuck!?
“Someone left him a note!?”
Usami nodded.
“If this message ended up here in the trash, then that means Saijou was home at some point after five o'clock.”
That's right... if Saijou had left at four-thirty as I had guessed, then the note would be in the mailbox, not in the garbage.
“The cab was bait. He only called it, he never got in.”
“No, I guarantee you he got in, took a short ride, and got out somewhere close by. Otherwise, the cab company would have told you something.”
I wish I had asked for the specific drop-off location when I called.
...No, I'm not the police. There's no reason for them to tell me.
“He got out nearby, and when he got back to his room, the note was there, right?”
“Right. This is an important clue.”
Usami clenched the note in her hands and stood up.
“If he didn't get the package, then that means Saijou might come back for it.”
“That's highly improbable. After all, he knows he's being chased by the yakuza.”
“So, you mean...?”
“Yes. The package will have been rerouted to Saijou's current hiding place.”
Usami took out her phone, and dialed the number on the ticket.
“Ah, hello... sure, the package number...? Yes, yes... 265... I'll hold.”
It looks like she's being forwarded to speak with the driver directly.
“Hi, could you please try to deliver that last package one more time? Ah, I'm Saijou's younger sister. Yup... oh, and where did Nii-san ask you to deliver the package to? The dummy managed to forget it himself, somehow...”
“Yup... the Central District's Plaza Hotel, great. Thank you very much... no, no, that's the place he wants you to deliver to, it's all good.”
The call ended.
“The Plaza Hotel?”
“Yeah, do you know it?”
“I do. I'll send some people over there right now.”
“Please do. And make sure every last exit is airtight. We can't let him get away this time...”
“Alright, I'll give Gonzou the scoop and ask for more men.”
After sending Horibe and the rest of them on a wild goose chase, I'll have to personally apologize anyway.
“I understand. See you there...”
Usami handsomely dashed out into the night road.
Well then, I suppose I've got things to do, too...
......
...
...
......
It's not like there aren't any variables whatsoever.
Naturally, my plan is perfect, but the choice of executor may present some problems.
The phone in my chest pocket began vibrating.
It was my loyal prince of Hell, ‘Mephistopheles’――Saijou.
“Did you delete the email I sent you?”
“Yeah, I completely erased it from my computer.”
However, if the police become involved, they may be able to recover deleted data.
I'll just remove the computer entirely from his room later.
“What do you think of the hotel? I hope you're satisfied with their accommodations.”
Saijou seems to be very upset.
“Don't take this the wrong way. I'm not questioning your power, ‘Maou’, but is this really okay?”
“Whatever do you mean?”
“These yakuza are unnaturally sharp. They probably found my apartment already.”
“That's correct. But didn't you foresee this and lay traps?”
“Sure, but... will those thugs even notice?”
“If they can't even solve a problem on that level, then there's no need to worry about them.”
“It's reassuring to hear you say that. You're right, I'm sorry...”
It's still too early to relax.
“There will be no problems, I promise you.”
As long as you don't make any stupid mistakes, that is...
“Then, about the next plan...”
“Right... I didn't finish last time...”
......
...
　Haru stood silently on a sidewalk outside of the hotel, staring at the entrance, completely still.
　Kyousuke had called moments ago.
　Kyousuke had to accompany Gonzou, so he couldn't come to the hotel personally. However, he sent every nearby member of the Sonoyama Group to her aid.
　The young men sitting on the guard rail looked like they were playing on their cell phones, but each and every one of them was actually watching the hotel's entrance.
　After ten o'clock, the sea of people thinned out, and almost twenty devilish-looking men appeared.
　After a few words of greeting, they immediately began preparations for raiding the room. The underground parking lot, the four exits of the hotel, and the fire exits were all covered. All possible escape routes had been sealed. Perhaps the men simply had incredible discipline, as they all set out to do their respective duties without a word of complaint.
　Someone had already gone in disguised as a would-be guest, and got Saijou's room number from the front desk.
　The only thing left was to charge in.
　Haru's thoughts raced as she walked along the hotel's marble hall.
　Silence reigned over everything. Perhaps it was simply excellent insulation, but not a speck of sound escaped from the numerous doors.
　――Why did ‘Maou’ choose to work with Saijou?
　With an accomplice, a criminal can achieve much more, for sure. However, at the same time, more issues also arise. Often, a brilliant plan by a brilliant criminal is ruined by a stupid henchman.
　Things just didn't add up.
　Naturally, ‘Maou’ had thought this out. He would have properly planned ahead of time. Even if Saijou did get captured, he would still make his escape. Nevertheless, bits and pieces of his plan would be pried from his accomplice's mouth.
　――So why?
“Right here...”
　A man escorting her murmured. He was a portly man. A golden chain gently dangled around his fat neck.
　Before Haru knew, she was already in front of the room that Saijou had reserved.
　Words softly floated from her mouth.
“Can you knock for me? I'll stand in front of the peephole.”
　Saijou already knows what Haru looks like. Even so, her image would be less apt to cause a panic than that of a yakuza thug.
　She took out a white scarf from her skirt pocket, and applied a bit of makeup. If she brings her face really close to the door, then the person inside won't see her clothes.
　Her fat entourage stood in front of the door and made a light fist.
　He knocked――
...
......
Hm...?
“What's going on?”
My grip tightened on the phone I was speaking to Saijou with.
“Someone's knocking...”
“At this hour?”
“Yeah. It's probably room service...”
“Be careful. Take a good look at them through the peephole first.”
Saijou's breathing dominated the phone signal for a few moments.
“It's a woman... a young woman...”
A woman...?
“She's got a white... hat, maybe...? I can't really see her clothes...”
Surely it isn't...
“Do you recognize her?”
He saw Usami once at the harbor.
“I... I don't think so...”
A vague answer.
I remembered Usami's outrageous hair.
Perhaps this was all within her calculations, but without that hair, the girl would look radically different.
“Maybe it's a delivery of some kind?”
“Don't count on it.”
I spoke flatly.
“I've never known a delivery person to bring something at midnight.”
Perhaps sensing my caution, Saijou also lowered his voice.
“What should I do?”
“Does she have any intention of leaving?”
“No... she keeps looking this way. She's barely even moving.”
If that's Usami, then why...?
A shiver crawled over my body.
How could she possibly have discovered this hotel?
“I have something to ask you.”
This may be the last time I speak to Saijou.
“Did you clear out all the garbage in the room?”
“Of course. I cleaned the place out, and took all the garbage to the dumpster.”
“......”
Then...
“Answer her. Open the door.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yes.”
“Very well. I'll hang up for now.”
“Right.”
There's no other way.
If they've chased him this far, there's nowhere to run.
Those yakuza, the Souwa Alliance, will have already sealed off all exits.
Not even a drop of water can escape their barricades. Locking himself in would only buy time.
　The knocking continued.
　But after five minutes, ten minutes, there was still no answer.
　She couldn't even feel the presence of a living person in there...
　Though she'd begun to waver, Haru contacted the front desk. She suggested that the man inside might have collapsed. The management informed her shortly thereafter that no one was answering the phone, either. After telling them of her intentions to check inside the room, a building manager finally came to meet her with a set of keys.
　The door swung open.
　――Why...?
　Haru bit her lip hard as crushing defeat gnawed at her heart.
My terrible assumptions were unfounded. The phone rang once more.
“It wasn't anything to worry about, ‘Maou’.”
“Ha...”
Saijou wouldn't call so quickly after being apprehended. I can safely posit that he's safe.
“The girl at the front desk noticed that I had dropped my passport and brought it up to me.”
“That's probably because you packed your things in such a hurry. Nonetheless, it's good that nothing happened.”
“Had me freaked out for a minute, though. I was wondering how the hell they could know I was in this budget hotel.”
“Your pursuers should be dashing to the Central District's Plaza Hotel right about now.”
I was just worrying too much.
In other words, I had overestimated Usami.
Usami could only go as far as the Plaza Hotel.
She couldn't possibly have predicted that Saijou might be in this cheap hotel in the Eastern District.
“You had me make a mistake on purpose, ‘Maou’.”
“Yes... ever since the incident at the arena, they had begun to underestimate you.”
“I probably couldn't have fled this well without your help, ‘Maou’. It's amazing that you came up with this so quickly.”
“You were the one who told me your luggage was set to be delivered this afternoon, correct? That was a great help.”
The delivery notice was left as bait.
The delivery man was sent to the wrong hotel on purpose.
To a hotel where Saijou checked in, but never stayed.
Instead, Saijou went into the Plaza Hotel and entered his room once, then left immediately and went to the Eastern District.
“This time I made sure to follow your directions to a T. I browsed websites hinting at Hakata, didn't delete the search engine's history, and left the browser open on that entertainer's blog.”
“Don't forget the cab at four-thirty. That way, even yakuza could infer that you were going to Hakata.”
“But the truth is that I got out of the cab quickly, went back to the apartment, and took care of the note at the same time.”
It was a bit of a dramatic masterpiece: a play that suggested he had left despite staying right where he was.
“Then I threw the note out with the garbage, so that anyone searching for a mistake of mine would dig it up and contact the post office.”
...Usami's limit was right there.
“You created a ruse within a ruse.”
“You left her the clues. All we really gauged was how Usami would interpret them.”
“In the end, the ‘children’ found an answer, and, intoxicated with happiness, stopped searching for the truth.”
The yakuza heading for Hakata, Usami heading for the hotel――they're all the same.
“It was a brilliant plan, ‘Maou’.”
“Oh, please.”
That wasn't modesty.
“Do you know of Zhuge Liang's Empty Fort strategy? At first glance, it's a brilliant tactic with a ruse within a ruse, but it's actually nothing more than a pathetic getaway scheme.”
In the end, the fact that Saijou is being chased by the Souwa Alliance hadn't changed.
It doesn't really matter whether or not this battle is won.
“Well then, let's continue...”
“Right, we were talking about that girl Usami...”
I mustered all the coldness I could.
“Let's kill her.”
......
...
I make a few appearances at the Azai Corporation the next day as I bide my time until evening.
The cold is beyond bitter, and snow has begun to trickle down.
“They're kinda late, ain't they?”
The only person on time was Eiichi.
“You bet your ass they are. It's been almost fifteen minutes.”
“I guess we just gotta bite the bullet. Still, though... little ol' me isn't used to waiting like this.”
“You do whatever you want, I'm not biting anything. The brats are late...”
I loiter around annoyed, and the sisters finally show up.
“Sorry for being late.”
“You...”
“Yeah, I know. I said I'm sorry. I know how fussy you are about your time.”
“Hey, Shiratori, what kept you guys?”
“...Nothing, really.”
“Huh!?”
“Hehe, I suggested we show up fashionably late.”
“...You little shit... what, is this another one of your tricks?”
“I really am sorry. I was hoping to see how much the two of you cared for us by gauging your patience.”
“Then I called it right. It was a trick.”
trick. Mizuha was urging me along, I'll have you know.”
“I-I was not...!”
“Oh, please, Mizuha. You practically dragged me here by my sleeve in order to keep them from waiting, remember?”
“Well, you refused to wake up. I thought you'd sleep through the concert.”
“...You shouldn't give it away, Mizuha.”
...Please don't tell me she slept in until evening...
...At what hour does Tokita go to bed?
“Well, hey, unlike Kyousuke-kun, I could wait for you till the cows come home!”
“Of course you could. But I'm sure Kyousuke-kun would be right there with you. After all, time spent waiting is so trivial compared to time spent with us, right?”
“Whatever. Let's just hurry up and go.”
“Hurry up and go? There's still an hour before the performance starts.”
“Are you an idiot!? The gates opened thirty minutes ago! We have pamphlets to read, season announcements to check! If we're lucky, we might even run into one of the performers!”
“V-very well. Let's go, then.”
“And listen up, you little shits! I better not hear a peep out of you, you understand!? If you walk in there without turning off your cell phones, I'll rip you a new one! Is that clear!?”
“C-crystal...”
“The other people are going to be bad enough; we don't need to make things worse. Classical music is a social intercourse for adults, so you better act like adults! I want everyone on their best behavior!”
behavior we ought to regulate.”
......
...
“So what'd ya think, brats!?”
The sacred concert finished, and I inspected the faces of my three companions.
“Well, I for one thought it was very nice.”
“Yeah!? Did you feel it in your heart!?”
nice.”
“You slept through the whole thing!”
Damn these worthless...!
Shiratori spoke up quietly.
“Was the cellist nearest the edge injured or something...?”
“Ohhhhh!? This is a pleasant surprise!”
“Wh-what?”
“You were really paying attention, Shiratori.”
“His timing just felt a little off in a few places, so...”
“That's exactly right. Something was wrong. If I were Dr. Lecter, I would have killed him for that.”
“But I still thought the performance was powerful overall. Especially the ‘Nutcracker’ excerpt.”
“Is that so? Well, you get a gold star for the day.”
“P-please get out of my face...”
“The ‘Nutcracker’ excerpt was my favorite too.”
“...I just like the timbre of violins.”
“Violins are my favorite too. The violin is the ‘Queen of Instruments’. Why ‘Queen’, you ask? Well, I suppose I'd have to start at the beginning of the violin's long history to answer that question...”
“Hmm... go on.”
“(Those two seem to be getting along well.)”
“(You think? Well, I guess she's doing something right if she can keep up with Kyousuke's ranting...)”
“(Mizuha knows a lot about classical music, you know.)”
“(Ehh? I woulda never guessed.)”
“(But not because she has Kyousuke's passion for it, mind you.)”
“(What does that mean...?)”
“(I found a copy of ‘Classical Music for Dummies’ in her bedroom. Cute, isn't it?)”
“(Huh?)”
“...That's the gist, anyway. Point is, Shiratori, Bach is the ultimate badass. You see what I mean, now?”
“Definitely, but... aren't you going to eat? Your food'll get cold...”
Apparently we had entered a cafe at some point, and I had a plate of food in front of me.
“Huh...?”
And at some point in there, I had sat down across from Shiratori and begun to earnestly converse with her.
“Why did you leave your tomatoes?”
“I don't like them.”
“Seriously? That's kinda cute.”
Hold on...
“Wait... where did Tokita and Eiichi run off to?”
“They left a long time ago.”
“Really? They thought they'd just up and leave us behind, huh?”
“You got a little belligerent and a bit out of hand.”
“Oh, come on. I don't remember anything like that.”
“It's amazing how you can forget things so quickly.”
She pouted.
“...Why didn't you leave?”
“Don't use that tone with me. I've kept you company far longer than I should have.”
“Mm. Right, sorry.”
I try to wolf down the food in front of me.
“......”
“......”
“......”
“......”
We don't exchange any words for a while.
This is awkward.
;[nm t="京介"]“なにか、話せよ”
;“なにか話したら？”
“...Mm.”
“Mm...”
I never thought I'd be eating a late dinner with Shiratori.
“So, uh... what's your blood type?”
“O.”
“Hmm.”
“What about you, Kyousuke-kun?”
“A.”
“Hmm.”
...What a depressingly bizarre conversation.
“Is it true that you like sweets?”
“Did Nee-san tell you that?”
“Is it true?”
“...I make them sometimes.”
“Really? I'm sure you've got something big planned for Valentine's Day, right?”
“......”
“Why'd you get so quiet all of a sudden?”
“Why do you care about Valentine's Day?”
“Well, I just figured you'd be making chocolate for someone, or something like that.”
“There's no one to make them for.”
“Oh, um... alright...”
“Why are you asking about things you have no interest in?”
“What do you mean, no interest?”
“The only thing you like is money, right?”
“What do you want from me? You want I should talk about the yen's exchange rate?”
“Go ahead.”
...What's wrong with this girl?
“Look, why do you hate me so much?”
“...Huh?”
“You know I'm involved with the Sonoyama Group, but that has nothing to do with you. So why do you hate me!?”
“You do bad things on a daily basis, don't you?”
“I don't do anything illegal.”
“But still...”
She shut her mouth tightly, then said,
“You trample on people's goodwill, don't you?”
“That's gotta be the vaguest accusation I've had all year.”
I mean, I've sat by and watched a few legitimate clubs in our turf go bankrupt, but that's nothing to crucify me for.
“Whatever. I don't care...”
“You don't care...?”
“I'll try to be a little nicer to you from now on.”
“You'll try t... oh. Thanks.”
“Nee-san said I should be more open with people. That's all, okay?”
“I see.”
“It's not that I care about you or anything.”
“I get it.”
“A-are you sure?”
“What did I just say?”
“Alright, good...”
She turned away again.
“Do you act this way because you're stressed about family matters?”
“Why would you think that?”
“Well, it's not like I care, but... you know, Director Shiratori's in some deep shit.”
“So?”
“Nothing. I met him at the Souwa New Year's party, you know. He told me to look out for you, actually... but that's all I know about the man.”
“Then would you like to go meet him now?”
“Oh, please. With my luck, he'd think I was your boyfriend and decide to kill me.”
“Yeah, Dad can be pretty scary. He chased away a journalist with a stun gun the other day.”
“A stun gun? I gotta say, your old man's not really the type to be targeted by street gangs...”
“He claimed he mistook the man for a hoodlum. You should take care not to be mistaken for a hoodlum too.”
Damn, what a scary guy...
“I apologize if I ruined your appetite...”
“...No, it's fine...”
It's getting late, so we should leave.
“Woah, snow...”
That single word, said with such wonder, came so naturally to her that I was taken aback for a moment.
“What? You've never seen snow before?”
“...No, I have.”
She glanced at me awkwardly.
“Bye.”
“Hey, wait up a second. Are we still on for watching that star tomorrow?”
“......”
She looked down awkwardly.
“Where do you want to meet?”
“At school, at around nine.”
“Huh? Nine in the evening? Why at school?”
“The school roof is a good place to watch the sky.”
“Well, I guess it's more accessible than the mountains.”
“Then how does your apartment sound?”
“I guess my terrace wouldn't be all that bad, but... wait, how do you know about that?”
“Ah, um... Nee-san told me...”
“Tokita hasn't been in my room either.”
“Well, Haru told Nee-san... I guess that makes it a rumor.”
...Well, whatever.
“Wait... is it alright to just walk right into the school late Sunday night?”
“Miss Noriko will be there.”
“Miss Noriko?”
“She's the astronomy club's adviser.”
“Are you in the astronomy club?”
“...I never go, but yeah.”
I didn't know that.
“Wait, does that mean we have to wear our uniforms?”
“Yeah.”
That's a pain.
“Do you have the equipment? I figure we'll be needing a telescope at least, right?”
“I'll bring what we need.”
“I'll be honest with you right here, Shiratori. I'm not interested in astronomy in the least.”
“I'll teach you about it.”
...‘No interest’ usually means I don't want to waste my time learning about it, either... but that's cool, whatever.
“See ya.”
“Yeah...”
Shiratori headed for the subway station.
As I watch her walk away, I think...
“Hey, Shiratori!”
I call out to her.
“What?”
“It's pretty late. Let me walk you home.”
“......”
Her eyes widen in surprise.
“Your neighborhood hasn't been as safe as usual recently, right?”
“I suppose you have a point. There was a yakuza bombing about a month ago.”
She nods, as if convincing herself of something.
“Very well. Escort me.”
We head toward the subway station together.
“This is far enough.”
Snow was falling heavily in the eerily quiet residential district.
“Alright, see ya.”
“Ah, wait. Can I offer you a drink?”
“I can't go into your house at this hour. And I definitely can't drink your old man's liquor.”
“Don't misunderstand me. I was offering to buy you a drink from the vending machine over there...”
“Oh, right.”
“Do you want one or not?”
“No. The time I spent walking you out here was worth more than a 120 yen soda bottle.”
“Then what about a 150-yen bottle?”
“...Still not enough.”
“Then what would you have me do?”
“Nothing. Don't worry about it. I'll see you tomorrow.”
I turn to walk away as Shiratori mutters perplexedly behind me.
“I-I had fun today...”
......
...
Shiratori's back slips into the crowd, eventually fading away.
I guess I'll go home now.
I return to my room, and not five minutes pass before I have a visitor.
“Whew, it's cold.”
“Wear something warmer then.”
It was Usami in her jogging suit.
“Well, out with it. What's this important talk you need to have?”
“Huh?”
“You told me to let you in because you needed to have an important talk with me...”
“Any old chat with you is an important talk to me, Azai-san.”
...So she just came to gossip?
“You look like you're on your way home from shopping.”
“Yeah, I went to Akiba.”
“Akihabara?”
“Yup. At least the people over there recognize how awesome this outfit is. They thought it was cosplay.”
Really...?
“What's in the bag?”
“Equipment for the upcoming battle.”
“Huh?”
“I bought so much crap that I could probably make a remote detonator. Not that a detonator's any good without explosives.”
“And what, pray tell, are you trying to blow up?”
“Your heart, of course.”
“Oh, God, that's awful! Was that supposed to be a pickup line!?”
“Ah, your comebacks are always so perfect...”
“That's not something you should fawn over.”
“Anyway, I hear you've got a big stargazing date tomorrow. Is that right?”
“If that's what you want to call it. Did Shiratori tell you?”
“Yeah. She's crazy excited, you know.”
“We also went to a concert today.”
“I heard about that too. Did you have fun?”
“I did. I don't know about the rest of them, though.”
“Why didn't you invite me too?”
“What, you wanted to come along?”
“No, not at all.”
“What the...!? Why do people love jerking me around so much!?”
“Aw, don't let it get to ya. Why, if it weren't for you, my life wouldn't be nearly as much fun.”
Now that's just plain depressing.
“Anyway, I'm going ome-hay!”
“......”
Her face tells me she wants me to comment on her humor.
“I'm going ome-hay!”
“Great, go on ome-hay then.”
“I'm going ome-hay and then I'm oing-gay to ab-gray some unch-lay with some town-upay oneys-hay!”
“Would you shut the fuck up already!?”
I kick her out the door.
“Can I come on your date with Mizuha tomorrow?”
“It's not a date, but if you want to come, then come. Nine o'clock, at school.”
“Okay.”
Usami closed the door and left.
“Ahh...”
I'm worn out.
What on earth is going on in Usami's head?
She's always following me around.
But judging by her behavior on New Year's, she doesn't seem to see me ‘like that’.
“...Well, whatever.”
I decide to just hit the hay.
I feel a headache coming on like a train whistle in the distance... faint, but quickly growing into a nightmarish pain.
Maybe I should go visit Dr. Akimoto soon.
I have a feeling I did something rude at our last session, but I don't remember what.
That guy is so ridiculous, thinking I'm a nutjob...
......
...
......
...
The snow is a much welcome sight.
It reminds me not to forget my anger.
I dispense commands to my subordinates using an untraceable cell, as usual.
The ‘children’ continue to flock around me.
They see me as a guide on their path to salvation.
They want to transcend their powerless existences, to grow from mere boys and girls into men and women of worth and value.
The ‘child’ I'm talking to now is no different from the others.
“I see. Well, seeing as how Vice-Principal Hashimoto's ordeal was a direct result of Director Shiratori's irresponsibility, I think your plan would cleanse Hashimoto's honor quite efficiently.”
I speak gently.
“Oh, no. It's a splendid plan if you ask me. Your father would be proud.”
“My first comment would be that your aversion to police intervention is very wise indeed. If dealing with a negotiator can be avoided, it should be. This isn't a film or a novel.”
“However... what contingencies do you have in place for the case in which Director Shiratori does not accept your conditions?”
The receiver brought no response to my inquiry.
“Haha... is there even any need to think? No contingencies are necessary. You simply have to kill the hostage. That's how these things work.”
Just take the life of Shiratori Mizuha, and be done with it.
“If you fail, come to me. I'll lend you strength once more.”
The call ends, and I slip back into the darkness.
Now... how much of a stir will this lovely child cause for me?
I only hope Usami has grown a little since last time...
......
...
